## Credits

Based on the excellent [Eleventy Excellent](https://eleventy-excellent.netlify.app/) starter by [Lene Saile](https://www.lenesaile.com/). All I've done is tweak a few minor knobs and dials here and there, to get things "just so" for my tastes. If you want a well thought-out and robust Eleventy starter, I recommend it.
