It's been about 3 months since [I last fully painted something](https://chrismcleod.dev/paintslam/2024/). I really need to get back to the painting desk and start making progress again. There was a period in there where I was managing to build models, even if I wasn't painting them, but that's also dried up in the last few weeks. Hopefully I can get back to my hobby desk soonâ„¢.
