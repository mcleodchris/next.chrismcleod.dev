I've been getting a lot of "so-and-so has created their first post on Threads" notifications on Instagram lately, presumably as some X holdouts finally move on to other apps. With Threads not having full federation yet, it's been enough to get me wondering if I should re-open an account there. 

I can't wait for all these sites and apps to be able to talk to each other fully, so I don't have to think about creating new accounts any more.
