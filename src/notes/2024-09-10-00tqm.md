I went to go have a look at [Space Marine 2](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-ultra-edition/9NSG45X64S4Z/0010), as my feeds are absolutely full of it at the moment. It looks fun, but not "Â£95 for the full game" fun (to me - you do you). I don't have nostalgia for the original, so I'll wait to pick it up during the next [Warhammer Skulls event](https://www.warhammer-community.com/2024/05/23/skulls-2024-the-annual-celebration-of-awesome-warhammer-video-games-returns/).
