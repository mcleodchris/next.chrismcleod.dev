On [the subject of phones](https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/new-home-screen-for-ios-18-beta/): I've been finding myself thinking about a switch to Android over the last week or so. The handsets from [Nothing](https://nothing.tech/pages/phone-2) and [Fairphone](https://shop.fairphone.com/fairphone-5) have caught my attention lately.

I doubt it's going to happen; I'd be the only person in my extended family to use Android, and I'm very deep into the ecosystem after 10+ years on iPhone. Those are big enough friction points alone. But the thought _was there_, which surprised me. Maybe it's the idea of something "new"â€¦ iPhone/iOS has been feeling a bit stale after so long with very little _really_ changing over that time.
