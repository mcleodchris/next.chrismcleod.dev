So after the saga which was getting rid of a legacy Google Apps service on my "main" Google Account, I had to create a new one. I thought it worth sharing the experience of this, to round out the story.

At first I setup the account with my primary email, with no need for a GMail account. This was straightforward enough, and I was able to setup 2-factor authentication, Chrome browser sync, and re-setup some of the mobile applications.

I had to re-verify my account via a SMS code for a number of services, even after setting up 2FA, which is no big deal really, but you'd think once would be enough.

After a couple of hours, I decided I wanted to make use of Google Now. To get the most out of it I would need to use GMail. No big deal, I can setup some forwarding and aliases to integrate this with Fastmail[^1]. Finding a usable address was the hard part. I must have spent a good 30-40 minutes coming up with and trying addresses only to find they were already taken. A "_username90872_@gmail.com" address would have worked, because I was setting up forwarding, but who actually _wants_ an address like that? Completing theÂ GMail setup brought a message that while my primary email on the account had now changed, I would still be able to login with the email address I had signed up with.

The Google mobile apps have a nice feature where, if you're logged into one of them, it recognises your details and you can quickly login to the others. These all worked a treat, except the GMail account. The GMail app picked up that I was logged in to other apps with to my account fine, but trying to login kept coming back with an error. In the end I had to "login as someone else" and login with the GMail address + password instead of the other email address I was using as my login. A minor annoyance, and one which might catch some less technical people out.

YouTube was normal enough, but wanted me to choose between posting as myself, or creating a new Google+ page to post as. I don't post to YouTube, and I wanted to keep my account as simple/clean as possible, so I went with myself even though I had a slight unease about it. If I did ever start a "channel" I'd probably want to call it something else, but that's a problem for another day.

I feel a little better about my account situation now. Overall, Google's account system is a deep rabbit warren of inconsistant WTF-ery, but once you make headway and get some of the key services setup, you should be more or less set.
