In a hasty move to try and head off a mountain of bad publicity, the RIAA settled out of court with the mother of the 12 year old girl they sued. The mother now has to pay $2000 in damages, for her daughters' copyright infringements (and, I guess, promise never to do it again).

Personally, I think it should've been dropped all together...
