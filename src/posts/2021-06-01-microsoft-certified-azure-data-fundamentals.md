This evening I completed (and passed) the [Microsoft DP-900 exam](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/certifications/exams/dp-900), which makes - [Microsoft Certified: Microsoft Azure Data Fundamentals](https://www.credly.com/earner/earned/badge/ea868257-c9f9-448a-a0b0-bc486ebefbf6) the first certification I can cross off my [Summer of Certifications](https://chrismcleoddev.wordpress.com/2021/05/21/summer-of-certifications/) list.

The exam itself was fairly straightforward. It felt like the natural follow-on to the general Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) certification I passed last year, and follows the same multiple-choice/select-the-right-phrase format as AZ-900. For the most part it meant knowing which Azure data service should be used in a given scenario, or what feature in a solution fulfils the need; for the most part it's usually straightforward to spot, but occaisionally there's a subtlety in the question which means the seemingly-obvious answer is not the correct one. But may that was just me.

To prepare for the exam I used mix of [Microsoft Learn's free online resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/certifications/azure-data-fundamentals/), supplemented by access to Percipio resources through my work, and [WhizLabs practice tests](https://youtu.be/Bz-8jM3jg-8). As someone who has been neck-deep in databases for years, I feel I had a bit of a leg-up on some of the more general topics - which meant it was really just the finer points of the specific Azure data solutions I had to learn.

Part of the exam syllabus covered Business Intelligence reporting using Power BI, which might be a good starting point for the next exam in my calendar: Power Platform Fundamentals (PL-900)!
