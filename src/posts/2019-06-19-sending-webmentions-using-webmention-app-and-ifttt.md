_Editors Note: The links to #Indieweb Textpattern do not work. I am working to port that content over to this site. This page will be updated when that work is complete._

I've added [a new article to #IndieWeb TextPattern](https://txp.kpw.fyi/articles/step-4-sending-webmentions-using-webmentionapp-and-ifttt) which covers integrating with [Remy's](https://remysharp.com/) new [Webmention.app](https://webmention.app) service to enable sending of Webmentions for sites which don't have that capability natively.
