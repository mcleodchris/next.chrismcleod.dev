Deadspin's great series "[Dead Wrestler of the Week](http://deadspin.com/tag/dead-wrestler-of-the-week)" has been around for a while, but I only started reading through them recently. The premise is simple; a look at the colourful lives and legacies - the legends, if you will - of a dead professional wrestler. There's a whole bunch of them, all very much worth a read, but for me my favourites are the articles on [Owen Hart](http://deadspin.com/5608464/dead-wrestler-of-the-week-owen-hart), and [Chris Beniot](http://deadspin.com/dead-wrestler-of-the-week-chris-benoit-1468485429). Both of these guys were among my favourites at the time of their deaths; both their deaths were tragic, in very, very different ways; and both deaths had profound effects on the industry in their aftermaths, something the articles dissect and analyse brilliantly.
