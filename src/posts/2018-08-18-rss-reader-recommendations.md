I'm one of those people who still cling to their RSS Reader as a way to aggregate and read interesting things and news. Even though half the feeds in my blog folder are dead, I keep them around in the hope they one day spring to life again as we all get tired of the social media walled gardens, and start publishing on our own sites again. I'm sure it's part habit, part convenience, part nostalgia.

At the moment I'm using [The Old Reader](https://theoldreader.com/), and using [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) to fix the horrible, horrible default reading experience. TOR has worked fine for me up to now, but I was already near the subscription limits of the free tier, and I have a whole lot of new feeds to import that would basically double the number of sites I follow.

I know I could just use [Feedly](https://feedly.com/), as the free tier supports unlimited sources. That's my fallback, but I left Feedly for The Old Reader several months ago, as I was becoming increasingly annoyed by some of their attempts to push Feedly Pro and team-based features. I just want to read my news, not create collections or share with teams, or whatever else they've come up with since. My RSS reader is not a shared experience.

So I'm probably going to have to start paying for a web-based reader, I want to make sure I'm using the best one I can. TOR is ok, but paying for something I have to use an addon to "fix" seems a bit silly.

If you're using a paid-tier reader, which one are you using? My basic list of requirements are:

- 3rd Party Apps can use it as a synchronisation source, so I can read on my iPhone or iPad.
- Support for 200+ feed sources
- A nice reading experience in the web client

Let me know in the comments what your preferred reader is!
