Note to self: don't book exams for very first thing on a Monday, as you might not get to finish your coffee beforehand! Bad scheduling aside, this morning I passed the [Microsoft MS-900 exam](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/certifications/exams/ms-900). This takes me to five certifications this year, adding [Microsoft Certified: Microsoft 365 Fundamentals](https://www.credly.com/earner/earned/badge/0fc01218-224c-4e42-8905-08ed56bd78c8) to the list.

I hadn't really planned to do this exam, and it was very much a spur-of-the-moment thing, largely driven by "well, I've done the others, so I might as well…" As I mentioned the other day, [I found this one a bit odd to study for](https://chrismcleod.dev/2021/08/19/varying-degrees-of-depth/). Although I passed, I don't feel I was as prepared for this exam as I was my others, even though I tried to approach it in the same manner I've approached [my other certifications this summer](https://chrismcleod.dev/2021/05/21/summer-of-certifications/). I really struggled to find resources which were both comprehensive _and_ up-to-date. A lot of the non-MS resources were from 2019 and 2020, but the exam was updated in 2021. That said, enough of the core information was available, and my view is probably being tinted by my initial… disappointment(?)… at my own performance. Yes, I know that sounds odd to say after passing, but I guess I just feel I could do and should have done better.

I guess if I had any advice to give about the exam it would be: study [the chart of MS365 editions](https://lazyadmin.nl/compare-microsoft-office-365-plans/) and what features are available in each one. There were a lot of _very_ specific questions on this - more than I was expecting - and I wish I'd learned it in greater detail.

As far as resources go, I used my regular mix of [Microsoft Learn's free study material](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/certifications/microsoft-365-fundamentals/), and the Percipio video courses I have access to through my work. As there is no Whizlabs module for MS-900, I used [MeasureUp](https://www.measureup.com/?awraf=75194C96120D3EA94F6A) for the first time, so I could have access to a reliable online practice test. It was good, following the format of the real exam pretty closely. I'll be using their tests again when I'm going for the AZ-104, AZ-204, and AZ-400 exams.
