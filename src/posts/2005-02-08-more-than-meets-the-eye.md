I’ve been fascinated by the Transformers – the “Robots in Disguise” – since I was a young’un. There’s just something about giant robots that transform into everyday vehicles and objects that is plain _cool_!

As is the way, most of my original toy collection was thrown out long ago. However, during the later stages of my stint at University, I happened across the (then) latest toy line. That was it – they’d pulled me back in. A couple of years later and I had a fairly substantial collection again, covering toys, DVDs and comics. For a while, I even ran a (now defunct) community site for fellow collectors.

I still have my collection, but it’s packed away in the loft, for the most part as there’s just no room for it in our home. It’s a bit of a shame, really, but it needs to be done. I think that I’ll probably sell it on ebay one day. After all, I think it’s maybe better in the hands of someone that can appreciate it properly.
