It's been 4 years since I built my current PC. While it runs perfectly adequately, I'm starting to get the itch to build or upgrade again.

I will reuse the SSDs, power supply, and graphics card, but any upgrade will involve a new motherboard, CPU and RAM. I'm leaning towards AMD this time around. Zen 3 looks great.

My case is reusable, but it will limit me to a Mini-ITX system - which will push the price up due to the "miniaturisation premium". So looking at upgrading that too could be worth it.

I should really upgrade the monitor too; it's around twice as old as the PC. But again, it's perfectly fine for most things.

Actually pulling the trigger on any upgrade is probably 3-6 months off, \*at least\*, so I do have plenty time to research parts and wait for price drops.
