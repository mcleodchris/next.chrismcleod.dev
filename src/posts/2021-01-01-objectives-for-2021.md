## A Short Introduction and TL;DR

I'm not one to make New Year's resolutions; the changing of the year is more-or-less just another day to me, and I tend not to assign it significance enough to make goals in advance. That said, I do like to set myself some objectives once I've got an idea for where the year might be headed. 2020 was a bit of a disaster on this front, but more on that in a retrospective blog post. Anyway, as I know roughly where I expect the first six months of the year to go, now seems as good a time as any to write down some of those objectives (in no particular order):

1. Get Promoted.
2. Get Certified.
3. Lose the Lockdown Weight
4. Continue My DevOps Journey

## The Objectives:

### 1\. Get Promoted

Shortly before Christmas, my project manager called me up to ask if I'd 1) thought about going forward for promotion, and 2) would I like to be put forward for promotion. About half an hour after that, my Director phoned me up along the same lines. Off of the back of the recently completed performance review exercise, they felt I was working at the level above where I was currently graded, and felt I was a strong candidate to pass the promotion panel.

I was humbled and grateful for the confidence they've shown in me, and I hope to reward that faith by successfully navigating the promotion process. I do have to give a presentation, which is not something I enjoy, and prepare quite vigorously (in addition to all my regular work!) but I'm reasonably confident in my ability to get through it all.

As the panel will be held in a few weeks, this is likely to be the first objective I succeed or fail at this year.

### 2\. Get Certified

[The Chartered Institute of IT Professionals](https://www.bcs.org/) (aka, British Computing Society/BCS) is something looked at from afar for several years. For reasons best known to the hidden, inner workings of my brain, I never felt like it was something I was "good enough" to join. The BCS was for serious IT Consultants, with decades of experience.

It wasn't until after the conversations I mentioned in objective one, and in the follow-up promotion preparation that I realised: "hang on, I _am_ a serious IT Consultant with decades of experience (two of them!)". With that brain obstacle finally overcome, I applied for Professional Membership. It comes across as a serious business: you have to submit your CV for review, and someone has to be willing to vouch for your experience and ability. I was accepted in less than twenty four hours, and as such, I can list MBCS after my name.

But my objective doesn't end there. Much in the same way other professional trade bodies certify members who meet strict criteria, the BCS does too - this was one of the reasons I had wanted to be a Member of the BCS in the first place. My objective is to earn my status as a [Chartered IT Professional](https://www.bcs.org/get-qualified/become-chartered/chartered-it-professional/).

Looking through the criteria and process, it's much the same as the internal promotion process I am going through right now. Early 2021 strikes me as an opportune time to get this done.

### 3\. Lose the Lockdown Weight

I'm not sure how much explanation this one needs: with all of the lockdowns, "stay at home" messaging, and well, stress, of COVID in 2020, my weight has gone up a lot more than I'd like. More importantly than that, I've felt my fitness and comfort dropping.

In late 2019 and pre-COVID 2020 I was successfully working hard to lose weight. I can't reinstate the exact same routines in 2021, but I have an exercise bike, [Apple Fitness +](https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-fitness-plus/), and a desire to get back on track.

I'm not asking for any sort of miracle weight loss. Just to feel more comfortable in some of my clothes again, and some signs of improvement.

### 4\. Continue My DevOps Journey

In 2020 I passed my first Microsoft exam for an accreditation. This came as part of a push to learn enough about DevOps and pick up enough skills that I could - at a pinch - take on a DevOps role or otherwise deploy the skills in a useful manner at work. As it was, I landed in my current project instead, and I didn't get to continue down the path much further.

But I'm conscious that projects tend to come to an end eventually, and DevOps skills demand has only increased over the intervening months. So I want to pick up where I was and take things forward again.

Internally, we offer a DevOps "boot camp", which is a short, intensive, pathway into the DevOps world. I took part in the first version of the course, but it's been refreshed and now offers a direct path to two further Microsoft accreditations - both of which I had planned to study for in my free time. I figure that if the company are willing to pay for these, then I might as well take them up on the offer!

The main challenge I'm going to have with this objective is time. It's a self-study course, nominally over a 3 week period, and then there's the exams to prepare for after that. With everything else going on at the moment, I simply don't have the time to spareâ€¦ and I worry about losing momentum. But this is part of the reason to write it down here - to hold myself accountable!

## Wrap-up

So, those are my initial objectives for 2021. Or at least, the formal ones that I'm trying to commit to. I have others that are more nebulous at the moment to write down, and others that probably fall more in the "projects" category than an objective. I might detail those in another post.
