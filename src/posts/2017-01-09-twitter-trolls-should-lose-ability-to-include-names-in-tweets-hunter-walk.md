Hunter Walk with a neat idea for dealing with Twitter trolls I've not seen suggested anywhere else:

> Basically the concept that when an @name is inserted into the tweet, it becomes targeted, the difference between just expressing an opinion about a person and the desire for that person to see the opinion. For example imagine these two tweets:
>
> “Hunter Walk is an asshole” vs “@hunterwalk is an asshole”
>
> The former doesn’t appear in my mentions. The latter does. I never see the first unless I’m actively searching for my name on Twitter. The latter does regardless of my desire to interact with the sender. Accordingly, once an @name is included, the standard for harassment should be lower, because intent can be assumed.
