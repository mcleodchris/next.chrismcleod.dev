Thanks to using 2 cork stoppers to elevate the back of the laptop up about an inch.

Typing on this thing (a Toshiba R500) has been abysmal for the 4 years I've had this laptop. The keys are slidey, mushy, inconsistent, and generally just a mess of bad design and ergonomics. Tilting the laptop at least makes it more comfortable. Thankfully it's being replaced soon, but boy do I wish I'd thought of this a lot sooner!
