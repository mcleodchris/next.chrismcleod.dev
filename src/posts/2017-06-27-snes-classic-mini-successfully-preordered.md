Apple have released the first public beta for the next version of iOS. I’ll probably hold off installing it on my iPhone for the time being, but I’m tempted to throw it onto my iPad Pro, to get some of those [sweet new features](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/26/ios-11-preview/) I’ve seen some people raving about.
