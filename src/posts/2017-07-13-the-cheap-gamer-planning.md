A great post (part of a [great series](http://www.evilkipper.com/category/painting-guides/cheap-gamer/)) from "Admiral Rob" on planning out your gaming purchases to save money and get maximum bang for your buck. Games like Warhammer 40,000 can be _really_ expensive, but if you plan things out ahead of time you can really make some savings.

In our [discussion on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MisterKapowski/status/885481266845556736) I pointed out another, related, way to save on new 40K armies: _remember the spare parts/kits you already have_. I'm terrible for starting a project and never finishing it for various reasons. I was thinking about reviving an old idea as a new army, pricing up all the kits I would have to buy. Then, when I was looking for something else, I found a bunch of old kits and sprues that -- while not the shiny newest versions -- would significantly cut down the amount of stuff I might need to buy. It's totally fine to repurpose stuff from one project to another, if it means at least one of those projects getting finished.

So plan things out, remember what you already have, and spend smarter, not more.
