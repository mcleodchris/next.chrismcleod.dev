[Firebird](http://web.archive.org/web/20030801074300/http://www.mozilla.org/products/firebird/ "Firebird"), the excellent browser that is a spin off of the Mozilla Project has had a new milestone release.

The latest milestone supposedly fixes a number of nasty bugs from the 0.6 release.

Can't say I've seen any differences, in the several hours I've been testing - other than a seemingly larger memory footprint - but that also means I've not seen any new bugs appear.

Hopefully this browser will go from strength to strength and provide a challenge to the out-of-date Internet Explorer...
