Andy Baio on short-form blogging, in [the post which inspired](http://waxy.org/2014/10/middling/) the "rules" from Gina, which [I linked to earlier](/blog/short-form-blogging/ "Short-Form Blogging"):

> In the early days of Waxy.org, before I launched the linkblog, I used to blog short posts _constantly_. Multiple times a day. Twitter and Waxy Links cannibalized all the smaller posts, and as my reach grew, I started reserving blogging for more "serious" stuff — mostly longer-form research and investigative writing.
>
> Well, **fuck that**. I miss the casual spontaneity of it all, and since I'm pretty sure hardly anybody's reading my site again after the death of Google Reader, the pressure's off.

The spontaneity is something I miss. Somewhere along the years (probably when the "pro-blogger" thing started to get attention), blogging transformed from a fun thing people did on the web, to Serious Business.
