We found a cute, but unused “little library” while out on a walk. As she’s always got some to hand, [Caley](https://youtube.com/@KapowskiReads) left a couple of books to get it started.

We’ll check back next time we’re going that way, and hopefully the library has started to get some more use… otherwise, I’m sure we can find some more books to donate and grab people’s interest!
