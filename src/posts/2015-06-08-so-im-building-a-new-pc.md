I mentioned a few weeks back I was [considering my choices for how to upgrade](/blog/the-upgrade-conundrum/) my aging computer equipment, and of the choices, building my own custom PC would be the most rewarding path to take. I swithered a bit on whether I _really_ wanted to do this, but in the end I gave in to the temptation to build something entirely my own.

Great, I know what I want to do, now how do I get there? It's been several years since I built a PC[^1], and I haven't been keeping up with the trends, or what's the latest and greatest in terms of performance, price, or anything really.

I had a few ideas of what I wanted - it needed to be small, as space in the office is at a premium. It needed to be as powerful as I could afford, so it would last a decent amount of time until it needed major upgrades, while being flexible enough to tackle many different types of task - development, gaming, photo (and potentially basic video/audio) editing, for example. In a perfect world, I wanted it to be as quiet as possible and look good.

The last few weeks have been spent doing research, going back and forward over potential configurations using [PC Part Picker](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/user/MrKapowski/saved/) before settling on an outline of what I wanted. I took it over to [/r/BuildAPC](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc) for a sense check, and was told my best bet was to change the graphics card for something more powerful than I had picked out. I rejigged a few things to make that possible, and ended up with the spec below:

The graphics card might still be swapped for another, similarly specced one, but otherwise this is what I'll be building in a little over a week's time, when I have some time off. I'll be talking more about the build, closer to the time, as I have a few things planned which will make it a bit more interesting than just a straight PC build

[^1]: It was in 2008. I checked my order history.
