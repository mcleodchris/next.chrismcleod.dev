To me, the obvious thing to do would be to contribute to and improve ActivityPub. It already exists as a standard, is fairly "battle-tested", and is used by Mastodon and other federated social media applications, along with having some buy-in in the IndieWeb.

I can't help but think they'll eventually decide on something new, purely so they can claim to have created it. "Not invented here" is a far too common hang-up for many technology companies.
