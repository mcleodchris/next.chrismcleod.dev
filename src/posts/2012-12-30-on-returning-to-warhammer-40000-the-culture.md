_This is part 2 in a look at the changes to our hobby I have witnessed since my return at the start of the year. You can find part one, which looks at the changes in game-play here: [On Returning to Warhammer 40000 - The Game](/blog/returning-to-warhammer-40000-the-game/ "On Returning to Warhammer 40000: The Game"). This part is a bit more ranty._

By far the biggest change I've noticed is in the general attitude and culture surrounding the game. In many senses it feels less like a hobby, and more like a competition. There seems to be a "win at all costs" mentality in a large section of the gaming community. I don't want to sound like someone espousing about the "good old days", but I find, particularly amongst the younger players things are a lot less friendly than they used to be.

Everywhere I look I see people asking for advice on building lists to beat their local "meta" (WTF?) - what happened to playing the game for the enjoyment of playing the game? I get that winning is fun, but it's not everything in Warhammer 40000. Our game is as much about telling stories as it is about playing to win. It's why I'm so glad to see the focus on "Telling a Narrative" in the new rulebook.

By all means, play to win, but if your opponent hasn't still enjoyed him/herself while losing, then you've both failed in my opinion.

Another cultural change I'm not so keen on is the rumour-mill on the Internet, and the general sense of... *entitlement* that the more vocal side of the community displays. So you don't like a miniature? That doesn't necessitate a profanity-riddled screed about how the model sucks, GW sucks, you're never going to spend another penny on their products again, an you could have done so much better while blindfolded and with both arms cut off... and so on, and so on. Put your toys back in the pram. Don't buy the miniature - or, if for some reason you are "forced" to - convert it; change it to suit your tastes. Just stop complaining about it. Likewise, when a rumour turns out to be off the mark, don't get all tetchy. It was just a rumour, after all!

Relatedly, your army (or an opposing army) is not "broken". It may need a rules update as we're in a new rule set, but that doesn't mean it's unbeatable, or can't be won with. Every codex has its faults, for sure, but nothing that can stop you enjoying the game if you don't let it. View any such "brokeness" as challenges to be met, and a test of your skill as a player. If you can overcome a "broken" army then you can take comfort in knowing you are better than any of the faceless complainers out there.

I dislike "mathhammer" as a way of proving something is awesome or that something sucks. If you're spending your hobby time working out a stream of maths over the chance or likelihood something will win you your next game, then it's not a hobby any more. Take what you're drawn to (my armies mainly consist of what I want to paint), and just play it. Leave the maths for professional poker players!

Right, now I've got that out of my system, it's not all bad, I must say. The hobby is bigger than ever. I can get tips and feedback from like minded people all across the world. I have access to a whole raft of information which just wasn't available before.

The things I've noted a dislike for above are merely the dark side of the passion 40K inspires in its fans. It's the same passion which drives us to spend hard-earned money and countless hours slaving over our miniatures and army lists. Properly channelled, that passion is what leads to amazingly painted armies and miniatures, brilliantly fun games and camaigns, and what ultimately brings players like myself back to the game after so much time away... and that is no bad thing.
