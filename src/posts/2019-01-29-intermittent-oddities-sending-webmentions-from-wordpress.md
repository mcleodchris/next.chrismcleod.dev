I'm having a weird time with the [WordPress Webmentions plugin](https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-webmention) right now, where it only seems to send a webmention when I update a post after the initial inclusion of the mention. So: add mention (a href link) to the post > update/publish > update a second time.

Until I figure out what's going on there's no way to be sure it's the plugin that's the having the issue, or something in my particular setup. Once I can figure that out I'll know whether to open an issue on GitHub or not.

Something else to add to the ever-growing todo list ?
