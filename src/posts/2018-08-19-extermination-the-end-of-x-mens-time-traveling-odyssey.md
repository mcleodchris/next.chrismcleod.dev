The story of the time-displaced "Original X-Men" was has been one of my favourites in recent years - and now it's coming to a close. I haven't kept up with every twist and turn since it began, but I might have to pick up [the new Extermination arc](https://www.polygon.com/comics/2018/8/16/17693312/x-men-extermination-marvel-series-cable), just to see how it ends.
