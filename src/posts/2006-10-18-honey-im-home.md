Hello again, you crusty inhabitants of the Interwebs. It’s been too long – far too long. But, like The Good Ship [Galactica](https://web.archive.org/web/20061105184107/http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/), I’m back.

I could bore you all with an in depth look at why I’ve not been blogging, but it doesn’t really matter. Suffice to say it’s been down to a combination of things: the stroke I had last summer; being a ‘family man’; that perennial favourite – work, and a general lack of enthusiasm about the whole blogging thing in general. I’d like to say this time around it will be different, but _I just don’t know_, so I’m making no promises.

So enjoy it while it lasts (i.e. as long as I do). Much like Stargate[1](https://web.archive.org/web/20061105184107/http://www.pixelmeadow.com/entries/2006/10/18/honey-im-home/#fn135528803445366fde335b7) really.

1 SciFi, _how could you_?.
