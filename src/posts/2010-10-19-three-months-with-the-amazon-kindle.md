[I previously wrote](/blog/in-search-of-the-electronic-book/ "In Search of the Electronic Book") about my search for the “promised land” of the electronic book. In that article I wrote about what I was looking for, why, and finished off looking at the top three contenders for my cash.

What I didn’t explicitly state (though I did allude to in the intro) was by the time of publication I had already ordered an eReader – the Amazon Kindle 2. As fate would have it, a couple of weeks later the new and improved version 3 came out, but we’ll skip over that bad bit of timing on my part.

So, was it worth it? Are ebooks the future? Is the Kindle any good? *Yes, yes, and yes*. I can’t put it any clearer than that, really. I am not going to go into an in-depth review of features; that is something best left to others. I’m just going to give you my experience of using the Kindle these last three months.

Since I received my Kindle (which comes in wonderfully unassuming – yet still quite charming – packaging) I have bought and read more (non-technical) books than I managed to in the previous 2 years. It’s amazing to able to buy a book and not have to consider where and how to store it. I’d even say it’s a tad liberating. Books have returned to being about the story, rather than the object.

There are some downsides – reading speed is noticeably slower than with a “real” book, but not as bad as some nay-sayers had tried to tell me. Battery life isn’t quite as good as I would have liked – the marketing for e-ink would like you to believe you only use up a bit of battery power when you turn the page, but this isn’t true. Even with the wireless antenna switched off I’m lucky to get 1 1/2 weeks of “commuter usage” – reading for ~30 minutes a day on the bus to work, sometimes also on the return journey. These are all problems with the Kindle 2 hardware, and by the sound of it, the Kindle 3 goes a long way to solving these issues.

The biggest frustration for me is disparity between availability of a Kindle edition than in print. I’ll often get a recommendation or find a particularly interesting looking book online, only to find out it isn’t available electronically yet. This isn’t a fault of Amazon, or the Kindle, but it does highlight the fact the book industry is in transition at the moment. I read a lot of sci-fi from small, independent, publishers who are just starting their own transition to digital, so this will hopefully improve for me by the turn of the year. *“Your mileage may vary”*, as they say.

These quibbles aside I have nothing but good things to say about the Kindle. It sounds a little corny, but the Kindle has reignited my love for books. I always have it in my bag when I commute to work, the convenience is such there is no reason *not* to have it with me.

As an aside, I found the form factor better than I feared it would be in my original article. Buttons fall naturally under the thumb when held in portrait orientation, and it feels almost weightless despite rock-solid construction. However, I did find adding the official leather case made it feel just that bit better in my hand.

In a nutshell I would heartily recommend the Kindle to anyone who enjoys reading. Right now it is *the* best in class eReader device, and I can’t see anyone else catching up anytime soon. Moving to ebooks isn’t a soulless experience compared to paper books, and to me the benefits far out-weigh the downsides.
