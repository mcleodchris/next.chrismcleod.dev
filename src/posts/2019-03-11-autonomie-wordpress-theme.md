A really nice, IndieWeb-compatible, WordPress theme by [Matthias](https://notiz.blog/). If I wasn't [developing K](https://github.com/MrKapowski/k-theme) (albeit, that's slowed down recently due to outside factors), or if I was still looking for an "out of the box" experience, I'd probably be using this.
