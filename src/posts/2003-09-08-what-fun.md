Italian hackers are trying to hack into my works' servers... Apparently they've been at it for a week now (I guess that's a good sign?). Unfortunately, all their scanning and probing, etc, means that our bandwidth for getting in/out on the net is virtually non-existant.

Bastards. :S

We've notified our ISP, but apparently there's very little that can be done... Which sucks ass.

Can someone explain to me, what the point in it all is? At most, they're gonna get a few project reports. Nothing that can make them money. Nothing that will make them infamous or l33t.

Bah. Probably nothing more than a bunch of fscking script-kiddies...
