This evening I completed (and passed) the [Microsoft SC-900 exam](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/certifications/exams/sc-900), earning my fourth certification this year - [Microsoft Certified: Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals](https://www.credly.com/earner/earned/badge/c20067ce-b4dd-4a34-92c6-4aad78a7a726).

This certification was interesting in a few different ways - first, it was kind of done "spur of the moment"; I'd passed my other exams and wanted to keep the momentum going, so I booked it without much forethought. Secondly, I've done loads of Secure Software Development Lifecycle training and documentation over the last few years, so I feel I might have had a leg-up on at least some of the fundamentals of this topic (pardon the pun). Finally, I genuinely found some of the tools referenced in the training to be quite interesting in and of themselves - something I hadn't appreciated before diving in.

As per usual, I used my regular mix of [Microsoft Learn's free online resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/certifications/security-compliance-and-identity-fundamentals/), supplemented by access to Percipio resources through my work, and [this great "cram" video by John Saville](https://youtu.be/Bz-8jM3jg-8).

I'm planning to have a bit of a break before I'm back on the exam trail; I next have some virtual classroom training in September and October, followed by Associate-level exams in October and November, which will be my last for the year.
