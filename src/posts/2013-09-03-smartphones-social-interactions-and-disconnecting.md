No doubt by now you've seen the video above - "[I Forgot My Phone](http://youtu.be/OINa46HeWg8)" - a fairly sobering take on how social interactions are being affected by the rise of smartphones. Yes, it's a little bit embellished for "shock" value, but there's definitely some truth to it. I meant to share it last week when I first found it via Twitter, but [this article on the New York Times](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/disruptions-more-connected-yet-more-alone/?src=me&ref=general "Disruptions: More Connected, Yet More Alone") reminded me about it, and I thought I'd share a personal anecdote along with the video:

Being "that" guy who pulls out his phone in the middle of dinner/a date/conversation is something I've been wary of for a a year or two now. Even though, I'm sure I've still been him more than once. Possibly the majority of us (certainly those of us with smartphones) have been at some point. We pull out and check our phones constantly, often ignoring the people around us in the process - [sometimes for an imagined notification](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/rewired-the-psychology-technology/201305/phantom-pocket-vibration-syndrome "Phantom Pocket Vibration Syndrome"). And then we wonder why our batteries never last a full day...

The last 6 weeks I've been forcefully trained out of the habit, and I'm kind of glad. The office I've worked in since the end of July is a bit of a black spot for data connections. I can get a weak GPRS (2G) connection if I'm lucky - there's also no WiFi in the office (_shocking_, I know!) to use as a back-up. Most apps time out on me with anything less than HSDPA it seems, so I can no longer use my phone as a distraction while I'm in the office. Slowly but surely I've found this lack of checking my phone has even crept into the days I'm working at home - on these days it's not unusual for me to finish the day on 80% battery or more!

My [current disconnect from Facebook](/blog/forget-deleting-even-deactivating-your-facebook-account-can-be-difficult/ "Forget Deleting: Even Deactivating Your Facebook Account Can BeÂ Difficult") has been both strengthened by, and in turn reinforced this new habit and the idea I don't need to be checking my notifications all the time. I'm finding that even if I do hear the tell-tale "ding" of a notification I'm less likely to rush and check it immediately. I may be imagining it, but I'm feeling a little less anxious these last few days, perhaps because I'm finally at a point I'm not anticipating when my phone is going to go off next.

If you wanted to try something similar for yourself, you can fake it by going into your phone settings and turning off 3G and/or 4G connections. It won't work for everyone, but it's worth trying for at least a few days, right?

Another thing you can try with friends as a means to reclaim your time together is any time you are together is play a variation of the "Phone Stacking Game". See the image at the bottom of this post for the basic rules.

These days I'm checking/using my phone during the times I'm commuting, while heading to the shop on my lunch break, or otherwise as and when I feel like it while I'm on my own. It's quite nice to own my smartphone again, rather than it owning me.
