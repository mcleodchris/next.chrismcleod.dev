I mentioned in the last post I was really enjoying dragonriding in the Pandaria: Remix event that's going on in World of Warcraft right now. I took a break from the game for a couple of years, so this is my first time trying the new "dynamic flying", and it is by far my favourite feature added to the game. I can easily loose 10-15 minutes at a time just swooping around the zones, and right now, Jade Forest is my favourite due to the size and verticality. I've yet to play Dragonflight itself - the expansion that was built for dragonriding and gave us the feature - but I figure I've got a couple of months to get around to itâ€¦

In the meantime, here's a capture I made of a couple of loops around the forest:
