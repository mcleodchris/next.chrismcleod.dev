If you step back and think about it, [Games Workshop](https://www.games-workshop.com/) produce a staggering amount of new products not only per year, but _per month_. It's something I don't think they get enough credit for.

New models across multiple game systems and ranges. New boxed games. New source material for those games. New paints and other "hobby products." New novels, novella's, short stories, and audio dramas. A new issue of White Dwarf. Not all of these categories will get something every month, but many will get several.

That's impressive, no matter how you feel about GW.
