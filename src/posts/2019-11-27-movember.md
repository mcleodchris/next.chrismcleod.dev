For the last 27 days I've been [taking part](https://mobro.co/14053989) in the [Movember](https://uk.movember.com/) "[Mo-ve Challenge](https://uk.movember.com/get-involved/move)" (it's not all about growing facial hair!), in aid of promoting better conversations around men's health. In particular, my motivation revolves around mental health and suicide prevention, which are topics close to my heart:

> Globally, the rate of suicide is alarmingly high, particularly in men. Too many men are ‘toughing it out’, keeping their feelings to themselves and struggling in silence. Movember is aiming to reduce the rate of male suicide by 25% by 2030, and I want to help them get there. Help me stop men dying too young.

There's still a few days left in the month, but so far I've walked over 220km. I'd originally set a goal of 120km, but I'm aiming for 240km by the end of the week (the official challenge is for 60km). For that, I've raised £120 at the time of writing.

And that's where you come in, Dear Reader. I'd very much like to meet my fundraising goal of £200 by the end of the month, or exceed it if I can. If you are able to, please consider donating even a small amount on my [MoSpace page](https://uk.movember.com/mospace/14053989): [https://uk.movember.com/mospace/14053989](https://uk.movember.com/mospace/14053989). Every little bit would help, and I'd appreciate it more than you'd know.
