I've finally filled in the missing corner. Everything has been cut, glued, clamped, and filledâ€¦ I've just got to sand everything down to size.

Last, but not least, the main building feature is 99% complete. I might add a couple more bits of broken columns, and there'll be some rubble added to the floor on the board, but otherwise its ready for the next stage.

It's bigger than I realised during assembly, running nearly the full width of the board, even when set at a diagonal. It's almost amazing how the scale seems to change as soon as it's placed on the board. Suddenly it becomes this huge, looming, monster towering over the battlefield.

I'll be adding rubble and scatter terrain to break up the rest of the board, and make it look more "lived in". Everything will be integrated using texture paint and extra grit and sand for variation. That's the next task.

44 days to go.
