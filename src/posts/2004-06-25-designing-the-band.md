I just discovered this [wonderful series](https://web.archive.org/web/20040803000000/http://www.7nights.com/asterisk/dtb.php) from [Asterisk\*](https://web.archive.org/web/20040803000000/http://www.7nights.com/asterisk/index.php).

Being as I have worked with bands before (while I was still a young wasterstudent), and still have a bit of interest in the [local music scene](http://www.aberdeen-music.com/), I've struggled along trying to create a website that promotes a band image, is useful to the users and is basically... something to be proud of. I must admit, looking back, I failed everytime.

Looking at someone else's design methodology is always refreshing and inspiring, especially if you can identify with the subject.

Hmmm. I (almost) fancy doing just one more band website...
