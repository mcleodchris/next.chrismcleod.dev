Great research from Ara Labs into [how scammy advertisers are working around the restrictions](http://aralabs.com/blog/2015/03/12/safari-to-app-store-redirect-from-ad-on-ios-8-2/) Apple put in place to stop the super annoying ["redirect to the App Store"](http://chrismcleod.me/2015/02/05/i-dont-want-your-app/ "I Donâ€™t Want Your App") behaviour.

TL;DR: frame busting and 302 redirects.
