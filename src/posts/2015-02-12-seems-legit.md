From the misspelt "From", to the poor grammar and different typography of the phishing "hook" (the "please confirm your account" bit)… it's like they're not even trying anymore. I did notice it's only the sign-in button which is a phishing link; all the others are legitimate Amazon URLs - which is probably how it got past the spam filter.

Reminder: never click any links in an email asking you to verify your account so that something bad won't happen.
