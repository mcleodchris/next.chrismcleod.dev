I took a trip with the family to the Christmas village today; before we left, one of the girls insisted, almost to the point of tears, that she wear her little sparkly shoes with a heel, rather than the warmer and more sensible boots. Eventually I gave in, as it wasnâ€™t that big a deal.

At the village she queued up for the helter-skelter ride with her sister. When the attendant checked their heights, she _just_ crossed the minimum height line thanks to her shoes, and she skipped onto the ride totally pleased with herself. It was like she knew before we left the house she would need the extra height.
