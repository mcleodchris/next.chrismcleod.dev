Some time around 8:45 or so, [I deactivated my Twitter account, in support of #DeactiDay](/blog/august-17th-is-twitter-deactiday/). Will it achieve anything? Probably not. [Inaction in the face of making decisions is very much Twitter's thing](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/17/17706256/twitter-alex-jones-third-party-apps-hard-decisions).

There'll probably be several posts on-or-around the topic of Twitter in the coming days, as I vent some pent up feelings about the site.
