It's taken me over 2 hours of fiddling around, but I finally have a working CI/CD pipeline working on Azure.

Dotnet 3.1 is the version the docs direct you to install and use locally, but by default Azure App Service uses 3.0. You can override it to 3.1 in settings, but Azure Pipelines doesn't seem to know about 3.1 yet (even as "LTS"), so will change your override back to 3.0 when deploying, unless you change an option buried away in the Release settings. But you can't change it to a value in the dropdown - you have to type in your own value.

And if you don't do this, your 3.1-base app won't run at all, with no helpful error messages (that I've found) to indicate whyâ€¦

But it's working now. Hopefully it stays that way and I can get on with developing something!
