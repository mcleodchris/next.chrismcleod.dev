I don't blog as much as I used to, or post about as wide an array of topics as I used to, but I've always believed the blog is the "natural form" of posting on the web: a site of your own, that you control[^1] and set your own rules on content and discussion; where you can post whatever you like without worrying about "The Algorithm". Everyone should have a blog, whether it's on a free service like [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) or [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog), a [crafted custom setup](https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/i-rebuilt-my-blog-and-didnt-write-about-it/), or something in-between.

Blogs never really went away, but they did take a back seat to the social media era. I've been blogging on various iterations of my personal site (on different domains over the years) for around 24 years. This is _my_ space on the internet (pun intended); I'm not beholden to the whims of social media platforms here, or their rise and fall. But still, I've spent more time _and posted more_ on those platforms over the last several years than I have on my own site, so I'm not judging anyone about being, if we will, "social-first" (or only). For better or for worse, social media opened up the web to a lot more people for a number of reasons too long to get into here. I do like some social media platforms, some of the time. But deep down I feel having your own site is _better_. For the web, and for you: the writer and the reader.

Anyway. A couple of coincidental things happened over the last 2 days that got me jazzed for the future of blogging again. Maybe it's going to make a comeback of sorts? That would be nice.

First, the [Default Apps post](https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/default-apps-for-2023/) from yesterday led me down a rabbit-hole. I was checking out the people who had also contributed to [the list](https://defaults.rknight.me/) when I noticed the [OPML file](https://defaults.rknight.me/opml.xml) of everyone with an RSS feed. Currently that's over 200 people. It might sound silly, but I've not seen a list of active bloggers that long in **years**, outside a few directories. It's more than double the number of sites I had in my RSS reader's "IndieWeb & Personal Blogs" folder after many years of slow curation.

Second, [by way of Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/2023/11/27.html#a213710), I found the [RSS Club](https://daverupert.com/rss-club/). Another list of bloggers â€” 32 this time â€” with the unique twist of committing to provide at lease some "RSS only" content[^2]. As the 2nd rule states: "Donâ€™t Share on Social Media". As luck would have it, the RSS Club also publishes [an OPML file](https://daverupert.com/rss-club/feeds.xml).

I keep mentioning [OPML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML) files. If you're not aware, OPML files are used as a file for organising RSS feeds. If you export your subscriptions from a feed reader, what you'll get is an OPML file ready to import into another service/app. So you could simply download the above linked files and import them directly into your feed reader of choice, subscribing you to everyone included when you initiated the download. The _really cool_ thing about OPML files, that some feed readers and clients support, is that you can subscribe to the OPML file itself. This means that youâ€™ll not only get the posts of anyone included when you subscribed, youâ€™ll also get the posts of anyone who is added to the file *at a later date*. As the list of of feeds grows, so does the number of blogs and posts you'll see.

[Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/) (one of the feed readers I'm a paid user of) supports OPML subscriptions[^3], so I added subscriptions to both of the files above. Already it's given me a big change in my reading experience. Blogs aren't being drowned out by news sites anymore. I woke up this morning to a couple of hundred posts to read on a very wide variety of topics; some serious, some whimsical, some somewhere in the middle. It was magical. It got me thinking about all sorts of possibilities around social media, blogs, and feeds â€” and inspired this post ðŸ˜…

Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but stumbling into such a trove of *active* blogs has enthused me about blogging as a medium again. It's sparked a thought that through a combination of increased blogging activity, declining platforms, and increasing adoption of open standards to glue everything together, that maybe â€” just *maybe* â€” we can swing the web back towards the blog again.

[^1]: Hosting terms and conditions notwithstanding
[^2]: This reminds me of the time I mused about setting up a site that was only an RSS feed. No web pages beyond the bare minimum needed for feed discovery, or maybe a splash to let people know what's going on. The idea never came to anything, but _maybe_â€¦?
[^3]: [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/), the other paid-for service I use, doesn't support OPML subscriptions. I was able to import from the files just fine, it just means I won't get any additional feeds. I'm still going back and forth over which service I prefer, but Inoreader now has a slight advantage.
