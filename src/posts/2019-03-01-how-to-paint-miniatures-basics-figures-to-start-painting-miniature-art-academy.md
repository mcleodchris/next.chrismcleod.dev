I've been a member of Alfonso "Banshee" Giraldez's and David Mommel's [Miniature Art Academy](https://www.patreon.com/miniatureartacademy/) for the last few months, and it's been great for me. The course has been fantastic so far, concentrating heavily on the "why" over the "how" and exposing me to new ideas and techniques. Both Alfonso and David are passionate about seeing what we do as painting on a 3D canvas, rather than "miniature painting," so apply many skills and tools used in traditional art techniques. If you're interested in improving and expanding your skills - or even just beginning! - I highly recommend the Painting Academy level.
