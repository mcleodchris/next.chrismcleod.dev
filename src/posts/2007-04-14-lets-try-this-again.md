I’ll be honest - I suck at blogging. I’ve tried and I’ve tried, but I just can’t seem to get it right. Things will maybe start off OK for a little while, but then this usually happens:

1. I start deciding what I’m writing about isn’t worth posting, so won’t post until I have something I think is really worth posting.
2. The blog goes silent for week/months.
3. I feel bad, so post a couple of weeks worth of rubbish.
4. I feel worse for writing crap and in a fit of frustration abandon the blog.

I’ve lost track of how often I’ve done this…

So what makes this time different?

Nothing. I just hold a bit of an affinity with Pixel Meadow, over and above any of my other sites - it was my first (and probably most successful) blog. I’m going to try and get it going again; if it works then great, if not… well at least you’ll maybe get a bit of a laugh out of it.
