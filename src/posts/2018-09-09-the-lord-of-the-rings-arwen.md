Similar to my [Lord of Blights](/blog/age-of-sigmar-lord-of-blights/), this is a "catch-up post" for a model I painted earlier this year.

Arwen was painted for the same competition, and she won her category (LotR Single Figure). This was my first time painting a GW Lord of the Rings miniature, and the different scale sure caused a challenge! I ended up stripping the paint off the model and restarting, no less than three times. In the end it was worth it. Not everything turned out how I planned it, but I'm still proud of the end result.

Next year I'll be painting Tauriel for the same category - it'll be interesting to see the differences in experience between painting a modern plastic and an old metal cast.
