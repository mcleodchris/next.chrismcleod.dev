I keep meaning to write a blog post about my adventures into 3D printing. I think I'm putting it off because it has the potential to get really, _really_, long. There's a lot to cover - both good and bad. I've got 2 types of printer: 1 FDM, 1 resin, and I'm very much enjoying both of them, even if they have been stressful at times. I was warned that 3D printing becomes a hobby in itself. I didn't believe that at the time, thinking it would be just another tool to use, but after 8-9 months of printing I definitely believe it now!
