I've had this idea on the brain for several days, so I needed to get it out of my head and onto the workbench. Unfortunately for me, the Ancient from the Dark Imperium boxset didn't go together the way I remembered, so this took a lot more work than I'd originally planned for!

If all turns out well, this might be the start of my [Armies on Parade](https://armiesonparade.com/) entry.
