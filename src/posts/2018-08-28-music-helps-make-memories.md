[Music helps make memories, by Om Malik](https://om.co/2018/08/26/music-helps-make-memories/). I've had some (minor) problems with long-term recall since having a brain haemorrhage in 2005, but if there's one thing which can help take me back, it's music, which I think is why I enjoyed Om's post so much.

> Music helps make memories, helps us construct a timeline. We all think of music as if it is an object, but in reality, it is the time machine of our soul, the ultimate flytrap for emotions.
