If you're a [Monocle](https://monocle.p3k.io) user, you might have noticed a new feature in your UI today. If you self-host, you'll want to update your installation to the [latest version](https://github.com/aaronpk/Monocle). Two nice "quality of life" features have gone live, and I'm a little excited, because I [helped build](https://github.com/aaronpk/Monocle/pull/38) one of them üòÅ

The biggest feature I've been missing in Monocle over, say, Feedly, is a "mark all read" button. I follow too many busy sources to be able to keep up with everything, so I frequently mark everything as read and carry on. It helps me not get overloaded.

[Aaron](https://aaronparecki.com/) had raised an issue to build the feature at some point, but I wanted it, and had a spare weekend, so figured I'd make myself useful!

In all, it was surprisingly straightforward. The [Microsub spec is well documented](https://indieweb.org/Microsub-spec#Mark_Entries_Read), so I knew how it needed to work. All I had to figure out was how to fit that into how Monocle already did things, and there was already a "mark read" for single entries to work from.

The UI took the longest to build, mostly because I had to figure out the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/) frontend framework. [Rosemary](https://rosemaryorchard.com/) had already [come up with some ideas](https://github.com/aaronpk/Monocle/issues/12#issuecomment-491537925) on how it should work, so the hard part had pretty much been done.

And with a little bit of testing, there it was - "Mark All Read" in Monocle. I've been running it in my install for a little over a week now, and I hope you'll find it as useful as I have if you're a heavy Monocle user.

I can't take any credit for in the slightest for the new "Show Only Unread Entries" feature - to my knowledge, that was all Aaron. It was a nice surprise to find once I updated my local install from the master branch!
