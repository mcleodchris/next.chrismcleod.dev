It's been a very long time since I visited the art gallery. Almost a decade, in fact. When the refurbishment was completed in late 2019 I heard a lot of good things, but before I could get around to paying a visit, COVID hit and we were all locked indoors.

With the easing of restrictions, we were looking for a quiet _something_ to do on a day off - and as Caley had never been, the Art Gallery seemed an ideal choice.

The visit started off well; I walked into what used to be the entrance, only to find it's currently the exit due to the one-way system they have in place as a safety measure. But once we got that snafu, things went well.

The gallery is so much more light and airy than I remember, with more natural light now. It feels a lot bigger, with more to see (even though half of it was closed off to prepare for a new exhibit). There's a lot of subtle marrying of old and new throughout which I liked. I also really liked the new rooftop terraces, as there's some nice views can be seen (and I'm sure more to come once Union Terrace is completed).

Overall, I was impressed, and I'm sure we'll be scheduling more regular visits in the future.

To the side you'll see a selection of the photos I took throughout our visit. I was consciously trying to avoid experiencing the visit just through the viewfinder, so there's not a huge number of photos, but even though, this is only a small selection of what I could have shared.
