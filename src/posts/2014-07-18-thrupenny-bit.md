When my ex-Mother-in-Law was young, she used to split her pocket money with her best friend; she would give her a "thrupenny bit" every week.

Fast-forward 40-something years later and they're still best friends, only her friend was recently diagnosed with terminal cancer.

While we were leaving the hospital with the youngest, after a "swallowed something she shouldn't have" incident (don't worry, she's fine), the Ex relayed the pocket money story and how she wanted to find a thrupenny bit to give to her mum.

Before we'd reached the hospital exit I had tracked down a couple of suitable coins in the eBay app on my phone, and payed for them using my PayPal account. A handful of taps on my phone and I've hopefully done something to help in this rough time. They should be here next week.

I'm not sure why I felt compelled to blog this little anecdote; maybe it was because it's too long to fit in a throwaway tweet. Or maybe it's because I thought it was awesome how quickly mobile lets us do little bits of good for others.
