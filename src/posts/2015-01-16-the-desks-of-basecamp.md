I love this [look at the desks/working environments](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3833-what-our-desks-look-like-2015-edition) of the Basecamp[^1] staff. It combines a couple of things I like to see - how people work, and home d√©cor. I find both to be a source of inspiration.

Personally, my favourites are Jason Z's (above) and Tom's (below) - they're both just the right mix of modern and clean, but with enough fun and clutter to give some personality. That said, I'm re-evaluating my own work-from-home setup at the moment, so I'll be pinching ideas from all of them!

For comparison, here's my current desk setup:

[^1]: I still think of them as 37Signals, because it's ingrained in my mind from years of following their growth.
