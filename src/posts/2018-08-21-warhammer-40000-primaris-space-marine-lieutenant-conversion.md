Continuing from [yesterday's Ancient](/blog/warhammer-40000-primaris-space-marine-ancient-conversion/), I figured that if this ends up becoming my Armies on Parade entry, I'll need an HQ, to give the force a sense of purpose.

This model was much less work than the Ancient. The only time consuming bit was removing the sword hand without wrecking the wrist armour, and replacing it with a Forge World power scythe. Other than that, it was just a head swap and attaching a couple of suitable bits to decorate.

I should probably add some Troops nextâ€¦
