I’m a bit of a phone addict. I tend to upgrade my handset every 6 months or so, whether my contract is due for renewal or not. Ebay is a wonderful thing. That said, I was hoping to put off upgrading for a while yet. I do like my [Motorola PEBL](http://web.archive.org/web/20061105184033/http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/less_phone_the_moto_pebl.php). It’s nice and simple, doing _only_what I wanted it to (phone/SMS/camera), wrapped in a nice design. Horrible, horrible, horrible, UI – solved by setting up a heap of shortcuts – but an otherwise nice phone.

Unfortunately mine seems to be going on the blink. GPRS flat out refuses to work any more (so no media messages or web surfing), signal reception in general seems to be decreasing, the in-built speaker is a bit… *spotty* and it’s developed a nasty habit of switching itself off now and then when in my trouser pocket. The first two problems point to a failing internal aerial.

I have basic needs for a phone:

- Good **as a phone**
- Good at SMS/MMS
- Fits comfortably in a front pocket of a pair of jeans
- Good UI

A few other features are “nice to have”:

- Decent camera
- Bluetooth sync with OS X (Calendar + Contacts)

I like Sony Ericsson phones; good UI, robust and reliable… apart from their clam-shells. Great to sync with OS X and usually great cameras. The old [s900i](http://web.archive.org/web/20061105184033/http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=global&lc=en&ver=4001&template=pg1_1_1&zone=ph&pid=10149) was a damn good (if rather chunky) phone.

I don’t really like Nokia phones anymore. The [Nokia 3210](http://web.archive.org/web/20061105184033/http://www.nokia.co.uk/nokia/0,8764,18161,00.html) was probably the best phone I’ve ever had (going old-skool!), but with the exception of the highly-expensive N70, their recent offerings seem gimmicky and/or plain-old cheap. Build quality has been an issue with most recent Nokias I’ve seen.

I could get another Motorola, but as mentioned, I hate the UI. I also dislike the feel of theRAZR and SLVR handsets – too wide/thin for comfort – and there’s the issue of whether I’d want another Moto after the first one failed after 6 months? Hrmm. [The RIZR looks cool though](http://web.archive.org/web/20061105184033/http://www.engadget.com/2006/07/24/motorolas-motorizr-z3/).

Samsung phones suck. I can’t put it any other way; from the design to the UI, they blow goats.

Having thought about it a little while writing this entry, I think I might leave things a while. My PEBL isn’t quite broke yet and there aren’t any handsets I *really* want to upgrade to. Maybe if I wait a couple of months something awsome will come along. [The iPhone](http://web.archive.org/web/20061105184033/http://www.engadget.com/2006/09/05/apples-iphone-the-rumor-resurrected/), maybe? So um yeah, this entry has pretty much been an inconclusive waste of mine and your time… That said, if you want to give a shout out for your favourite handset, please go ahead!
