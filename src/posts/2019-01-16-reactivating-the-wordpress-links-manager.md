Following on from [my last bookmark](/blog/bookmarked-how-to-start-your-own-little-directory-on-wordpress-for-free/), it seems to be really simple to reactivate the built-in Links Manager for WordPress. Just add the following to your theme's `functions.php`:

```php

/**
 * Re-enable the built-in Links manager
 */
add_filter( 'pre_option_link_manager_enabled', '__return_true' );
// Add Shortcode
add_shortcode( 'links', 'wp_list_bookmarks' );
```

I haven't checked to see if there are any "gotcha's" with this, but it seems to work as expected. Once done, add the shortcode `[[links]]` to a page, passing in any parameters [as per wp_list_bookmarks()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/wp_list_bookmarks).

[I've already added this to K](https://github.com/MrKapowski/k-theme/blob/90faebfe2e01bcccd353a2ca276ddcc93d439a50/inc/template-functions.php#L156).

**Update 18/Jan/2019:** After some further testing, the shortcode doesn't actually work very well, so I don't recommend you use that. I've switched my Links page to use a page template which calls `wp_list_bookmarks()` directly instead. The Links Manager still works, though I had some early issues with assigning categoriesâ€¦ deleting them and starting over seemed to fix whatever internal taxonomy relationship was broken. I'm going to leave the Links Manager activation filter in K, but I've removed the shortcode.
