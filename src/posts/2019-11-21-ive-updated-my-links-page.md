I've updated [my Links page](https://mrkapowski.com/links), adding RSS/feed data to every record I could, so [Inoreader](/blog/inoreader/) will pick up the feeds from [my OPML file](https://mrkapowski.com/wp-links-opml.php). I've also started adding all of the missing "follows" I have - starting with my old Feedly export, then I'll add any missing from Aperture. So far I've added a bunch of blogs on various topics, and a new category for Scotland-focussed content.

Classifying sites has been one of the tricker aspects of this exercise so far! Some of my subscriptions date back 15+ years, and no site remains confined to a single topic for that long. For many I've been going with "what does this person _do_?" rather than what they're currently writing about. Others are matched up with how I categorised them when I first subscribed (more or less). If I end up adding more categories I'll reevaluate where some sites sit, but I'm keeping the number of categories as small as I can.

I've trimmed off a few dead sites, but - I confess -Â  I've left just as many still on the list in the hope they spring back to life one day.
