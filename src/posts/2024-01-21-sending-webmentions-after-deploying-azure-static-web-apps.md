I recently switched this site from Netlify to [Azure Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/app-service/static/) (SWA). For the most part it just worked - setup the site in the Azure portal, switch the DNSâ€¦ done. You probably didn't notice.

There were a couple of things which didn't immediately work because they were set up in a Netlify-specific way: HTTP headers, redirects, and sending webmentions after deploying a new version of the site. HTTP headers and redirects can be handled in [the SWA configuration file](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/static-web-apps/configuration), so thy were easy enough to fix. [Webmentions](https://rknight.me/blog/what-even-is-a-webmention/) was looking to be a bit more tricky.

On Netlify I was able to create a post-deployment event which called a webhook. This action called[ Remy's](https://remysharp.com/) [Webmention.app service](https://webmention.app/) to scan the site feed and send to any discovered webmention targets. Unfortunately, SWA doesn't have an obviously comparable feature, so I thought I was going to be stuck webmention-less for the foreseeable future.

Thankfully, Sophie [posted a guide on how she sends webmentions from her static site](https://localghost.dev/blog/sending-webmentions-from-a-static-site/). This reminded me that Remy also provides a CLI version of the Webmention tool, as an NPM package, that doesn't rely on the web service. And then, to top it off, she posted [how she deploys her Eleventy site to Neocities](https://localghost.dev/blog/how-i-deploy-my-eleventy-site-to-neocities/) and reminded me of something else that let me put everything together: GitHub Actions.

Hooking SWA up to your GitHub repository creates a GitHub Actions workflow file in your repository. This file handles the building of your site and deployment to SWA. GitHub Actions workflows can run commands, so I could use the CLI webmention tool after the auto-generated build-and-deploy step. All I needed to do was get the configuration right.

After a bit of tinkering with the CLI running in "dry-run" mode, the addition to my workflow file looks like this:

```yaml
- name: Webmentions
        id: webmentions
        run: |
          npx -y @remy/webmention dist/feed.xml --limit 1 --send
```

Other than this addition, my workflow file is the default generated by the Azure portal. For context, my complete workflow file now looks like this:

```yaml
name: Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD

    branches:
      - develop
