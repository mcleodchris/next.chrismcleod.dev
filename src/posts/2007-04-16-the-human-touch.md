On Saturday, I blogged about [my experiences of buying Photoshop Lightroom the Adobe.com store](/blog/id-be-a-lightroom-buyer-if-adobe-would-let-me/ "I’d Be A Lightroom Buyer If Adobe Would Let Me"). Tonight I came home to an email from Tom Hogarty, Product Manager of the Lightroom team.

I’m not going to quote the email - there’s no need to, really - but for a product manager of a big, giant corporation like Adobe to even *notice* a single blogger talking about some trouble with the store, let alone take time to personally respond to said blogger, was something which took me by surprise. (I hope Apple are listening - I’ve got a whole raft of issues to take you up on!)

By doing so, Tom humanized Adobe (just a little). It’s nice when someone takes notice of you.

Anyway, the end result is that I’ve phoned my card issuer(s) and tried again at the Adobe.com store. The credit card payment seemed to go through, but my order is currently listed as “Pending” (it’s a download only purchase). However I’m sure before long I’ll be enjoying some full Lightroom goodness again.

**\[Update\]** Order fulfilled, and serial codes received. Happy endings all round!
