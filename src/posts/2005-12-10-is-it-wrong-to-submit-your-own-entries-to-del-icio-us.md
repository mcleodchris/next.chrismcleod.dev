Side-stepping the [other del.icio.us items](http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/12/yahoo.html) you will see today…

I was browsing through [Darren’s ProBlogger site](http://www.problogger.net/) (despite railing against much of the “pro-blogger” hype a few days ago, I still find it all fascinating) when I came across a post entitled[“Social Bookmarking – Getting your Blog Noticed”](http://www.problogger.net/archives/2005/08/16/social-bookmarking-getting-your-blog-noticed/). Much of it makes sense – get your site listed on a “social” site like [Digg](http://www.digg.com/), [Slashdot](http://www.slashdot.com/) or [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) and you’ll get a boost in site traffic. It makes sense, but it also raises a question in my mind – _does submitting your own site/entries to these sites go against the spirit and ethos of the sites in question_? Or is it just harmless self promotion?

Lets come back to del.icio.us for my example. It’s a sort of social-network, global bookmarks folder… and how often do you bookmark your own entries in your browser favorites? You could counter-argue you’re just highlighting something others may find interesting, but where do you draw the line? When does it become spamming?
