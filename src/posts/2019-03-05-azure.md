I (finally) set myself up with an Azure account today, as I needed to research something about Azure Active Directory. The more I explore around the portal, the more I think I should really start figuring out Azure, because it seems incredibly cool and powerful. I know this is old news to many of you. I just haven't had much opportunity to dive in to it.

Are there any good resources you would recommend for getting started? Let me know! I'd be looking at it from a web apps perspective (PHP mainly, possibly Node or ASP.NET), but I'd be keen to hear just as much about the workflows and developing for the cloud in general.
