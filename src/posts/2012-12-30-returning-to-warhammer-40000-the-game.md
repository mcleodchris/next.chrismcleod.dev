I have been out of the hobby for a long time. This was made clear to me when I realised the majority of the regular players at the local Games Workshop store weren't even born (or were still in nappies) when I last rolled the dice in anger.

When I last played properly, Warhammer 40,000: 2nd edition was still the dominant ruleset (3rd had *just* come out when I put down my heavy flamer template). Dark Eldar were brand new. Necrons only had about 3 models in the entire line. Space Marines consisted of: Ultramarines, Blood/Dark Angels, Space Wolves, and _miscellaneous_. Sisters of Battle had their own codex, and it was *good*. Templates were bigger. Wargear came as cards. We needed dice with more than 6 sides. The world - and the game - was a very different place.

Change is inevitable, particularly if anything is to survive as long as Warhammer 40000 has. 25 years is a long stretch for what is realistically a niche game/hobby. Off the top of my head, here are just a few things which are entirely new to Warhammer 40,000, from my perspective:

- Tau
- Grey Knights having a codex entry (with points costs), never mind an _entire codex_
- The Force Organisation Chart
- Deep Strike/Reserves
- Missions, objectives, warlord traits, etc.
- Flyers

Other notable changes include most special rules (sniper, feel no pain, eternal warrior, and so on), completely revamped movement rules, cover working completely differently, close combat (sorry, "assault") changes... I could go on all day, to be honest!

Some of this change is good. Assault is _generally_ a lot quicker and more streamlined when compared to 2nd edition. No more (as an example) Space Marine assault squads with 10 different weapon combinations, due to itemisation streamlining. Less rediculous weapon effects - prime example being armour penetration against vehicles (D20 + D4 + D6 + 10 for a chainfist... don't even get me started on lightning claws!). Many parts of the game are more sensible than those of old. The FOC is a brilliant addition to the game in my view.

Other changes I am on the fence about... generally because it seems at times I'm rolling dice for the sake of rolling dice. Random charge/run lengths are the first thing which comes to mind. The various  terrain tests are another. Random missions, random deployment types, randon warlord traits, random psykic powers, random special rules and effects, objectives... on average I find it can take around 20 minutes of faffing about rolling on various tables and setting up stuff (other than my army) before I actually get to *play* the game. While on the one hand it leads to more varied games, on the other it takes an unnecessary length of time in my view.

One thing I have an impression of - and correct me if I'm wrong - is that overall, points costs are lower than before. This might be why games seem to be a lot bigger than I remember. Time was you'd have ~2 squads, a character, and a cheapish vehicle in an average game (1000-1500 points or so). Now I'm seeing games with scores of infantry, a couple of characters, multiple vehicles and creatures, all at around the same points level as before. The jury is still out on whether I see this as a positive change.

Nightfighting I hate with the heat of a thousand burning suns! But that's just because I've never really wrapped my head around it in a way that doesn't have me reaching for the rule book every 5 minutes.

_Originally this post was a lot longer, and took a look at the cultural changes I've seen within the hobby since my return, but I decided it would be best to split this off into its own post, which you can read here: [On Returning to Warhammer 40000: The Culture](/blog/on-returning-to-warhammer-40000-the-culture/ "On Returning to Warhammer 40000: The Culture")._
