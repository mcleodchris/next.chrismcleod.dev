Finally, I got around to my first Associate-level Microsoft certification. I'd originally planned to sit the AZ-204 exam for the Azure Developer Associate certification in November, as a follow-on to sitting AZ-104 in September. I'd fit AZ-102 somewhere after those, as I just wanted to do that one for fun. In the end, that all turned out to be too ambitious; with work being as busy as it turned out to be, and me quickly realising I'd bitten off more than I could chew, I kicked both exams further down the road. Both were pushed into February, while I figured out how I wanted to approach things. I decided I would give myself space to pass one Associate exam before committing to any more. For whatever reason, on the day I made the decision I was more confident about the Azure Developer material (funny that, given I'm a _Lead Developer_!), rather than the Administrator course, so I went with that. But I still needed a deadline, preferably not too far in the future, so March 31st was picked!

The last week of February, and all of March was given over to study in the evenings and some weekends. I used the official Microsoft Learn materials - both the new set linked from the certification page, and the older, more in-depth material which was previously tagged. When I started out I would do a practice test once a week to see how I was doing, and for a while it felt like I was doing pretty badly! Test scores were regularly around 65% until it started to sink in around weeks 3-4 and scores started to creep up slowly. At that point I started doing tests every day on MeasureUp - which has a nice feature where you can set the practice test to have just questions you haven't seen in your previous _N_ practices - and every other day on Whizlabs.

As the exam approached I was feeling really confident: I was starting to regularly score 95%, with an average score of ~85%, and practice tests under exam conditions were taking less than 30 minutes. While I didn't think the exam would be easy, I was thinking I was in a good place.

The exam itself wasâ€¦ _ouch_. Much of it seemed at the time like it was something the learning material had only skimmed over, and I didn't have nearly as many "I recognise that question!" moments as I did in the Fundamentals exams. It was easily the hardest Microsoft exam I'd taken, possibly one of the hardest exams I've ever taken. Question after question felt unfamiliar and not something I'd covered in study or practice. In my defence, a lot of the question wording left something to be desired. This is a constant complaint of mine with MS exams - the questions often feel like they are incomplete sentences, badly translated, or both. I remember one question asked me to pick a solution with barely any context to go on - I spent a good 5 minutes rereading the entire page and checking I hadn't missed a link to an exhibit or case study that would allow me to intuit an answer! Looking back, I can see things a bit clearer-eyed and relate the questions I remember to the material, but at the time I had such a sinking feeling I would fail the exam.

But in the end, my preparation didn't let me down. As unconfident as I felt part-way through the exam, I still passed comfortably, with a good score that was slightly above my average practice score.

So now that AZ-204 is out of the way, what's next? I still want to do AZ-104 (Azure Administrator Associate), but I'm not in a hurry to repeat the gruelling exam experience just yet. Hopefully I can squeeze it in this year though. I'm also one step closer to reaching my ultimate goal - Microsoft Certified: DevOps Engineer Expert (AZ-400) - of which, Azure Developer Associate is one of the pre-requisites.

More importantly - I want to actually use more of what I learned! I feel like I've still only barely scratched the surface of Azure. While much of it is overkill for the simple side projects like I do in my spare time, I still have a few ideas in my head for what I could be using it for.
