So what have I been up to? The usual really. Been to some absolutely fantastic gigs. Got some photo's of some of them too. I'll put them up soon(ish).

Other than that, it's been exam time. Fun...

Also been working a little. Start full-time work on the 3rd of June :-)

Other than the above, I've just basically been going out, having a laugh, etc. I'm waiting on the new Star Wars film to come out. It's gonna be ace!

Also been buying lots of Transformers related stuff recently. Getting back to my youth kinda thing really...
