I implemented proper pagination between archive pages last night, which should help making getting around the site slightly easier. I still need to implement pagination for pages/posts that are split into distinct pages. I'm not going to implement comment pagination, because I don't like it.

Alongside this, I've added some templates for archive pages and search results. There's nothing much to these, but it does give me flexibility to give these their own special formatting if I want to.

I need to come up with a better archive page than the current “[Sitemap](/sitemap)”. The current “design” was inspired by [the archive page on Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/archive/). It works fine if you're only posting a couple of items a week, but [in January I posted 112 items](https://mrkapowski.com/2019/01/)[^1]. I'll probably keep the sitemap for discoverability purposes, but a more friendly archive page has been added to the todo list.

[^1]: That's almost twice the previous high water mark of August 2018.
