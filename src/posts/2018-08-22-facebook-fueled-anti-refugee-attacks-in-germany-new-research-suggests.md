**Edit, 24-Aug-2018**: The veracity of this study has been called into serious question. [There's a really good, in-depth article about the many issues with the study, on Techdirt](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180823/00122840491/dubious-studies-easy-headlines-no-new-report-does-not-clearly-show-facebook-leads-to-hate-crimes.shtml). Rather than just delete this post, as it already gets a bit of traffic I thought it more helpful to add the (better researched) counter to it front and centre.

The New York Times: [Facebook Fueled Anti-Refugee Attacks in Germany, New Research Suggests](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/world/europe/facebook-refugee-attacks-germany.html)

> Karsten Müller and Carlo Schwarz, researchers at the University of Warwick, scrutinized every anti-refugee attack in Germany, 3,335 in all, over a two-year span. In each, they analyzed the local community by any variable that seemed relevant. Wealth. Demographics. Support for far-right politics. Newspaper sales. Number of refugees. History of hate crime. Number of protests.
>
> One thing stuck out. Towns where Facebook use was higher than average, like Altena, reliably experienced more attacks on refugees. That held true in virtually any sort of community — big city or small town; affluent or struggling; liberal haven or far-right stronghold — suggesting that the link applies universally.
