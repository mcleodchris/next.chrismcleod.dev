**I have none, because we haven't seen enough full information - _in context_ - to make any informed opinions.**

And neither have you. I get it, change is scary. But stop whining on the internet about AoS before you have all the information. Please? It'll make the transition much more pleasant for you, me, and everyone else.

I'm flabbergasted by how quickly it all went from "ok, this looks like it could be fun and interesting," to "ZOMG! The sky is falling! F-you GW! This is the most ridiculous and crappy game _EEEEHHHVVAR!_"

And it hasn't even been officially revealed yet. Careful; your knee is jerking so hard you might do yourself an injury.

I do have one final, parting thought to leave you with:

If you want a balanced, tournament-friendly (and 1st-party supported!) Fantasy massed-battle game that plays like a "Warhammer 9th" - basically what everyone complaining the loudest seems to be lamenting Age of Sigmar **is not** - then I humbly suggest you go check out [Kings of War](http://www.manticgames.com/games/kings-of-war.html). 2nd Edition is right around the corner, with the beta rules available for free download. A number of Warhammer Fantasy armies port over to KoW with little-to-no modification or need to buy new models. It's fast, deceptively simple, fun, well written, and actively supported. If you're up in arms about AoS, it wouldn't hurt to check it out.
