> My blog’s older than Twitter and Facebook, and it will outlive them. It has seen Flickr explode and then fade. It’s seen Google Wave and Google Reader come and go, and it’ll still be here as Google Plus fades. When Medium and Tumblr are gone, my blog will be here.

> The things that will last on the internet are not owned. Plain old websites, blogs, RSS, irc, email.

These days I use Social Media more than I write in this blog, though it wasn't always that way. Mostly that comes down expediency - it's quicker to share a trivial thought or link on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/MstrKapowski) than write a post about it. Social Media, to get all Silicon Valley on you, is for _ephemeral_ sharing. I don't expect any of it to last, or be noticed beyond the <20 seconds it appears at the top of someone's "feed." It's fleeting, and I think of it as such.

If I want to record something more substantial, or which will last, I use this blog. Maybe not as often as I should, and sometimes I've not cared for backing up [the archives](/blog) as much as I should have[^1]. But the blog has endured anyway.

[^1]: If I'd looked after it properly, there would be _hundreds_ more posts in there, particularly from 2000 to 2008.
