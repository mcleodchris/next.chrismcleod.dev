The first units of my Sororitas are complete, taking me most of the way towards that part of my 2019 hobby goals, and marking my first entries on the PaintHammer 2019 form.

As always, there's loads I'd like to be done better on these (the white robes mainly) but finished is better than still in the WIP queue, so Im trying not to nitpick too hard!

The Imagifier will be getting her banner as soon as I find the copper foil I bought to make it.
