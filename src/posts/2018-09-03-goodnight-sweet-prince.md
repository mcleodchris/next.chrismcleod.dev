You served me faithfully for the last 2-3 years of hobbying, your nozzle only blocking every 5 or 6 applications. Even though I've already moved on to your replacement, I'm comforted to know your last drops were spent glueing together our [largest project yet](/blog/armies-on-parade-board-update/).
