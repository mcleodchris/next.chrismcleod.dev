I'm getting an urge to switch my main desktop PC back to some flavour of Linux. It's been a couple of years, and the Windows Subsystem for Linux has been adequate, but I've never been able to get it to work 100%. There's always something complaining, that should be working "cross-platform" out of the box.

Although, to be honest, for all the time I get on the desktop these days it's probably just change for the sake of changeâ€¦
