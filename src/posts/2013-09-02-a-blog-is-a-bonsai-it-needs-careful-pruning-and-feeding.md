I've spent some time this weekend making doing some much-needed housekeeping here, in order to keep it tidy and in a healthy state.

I've always found good blogging is more than just adding post after post. It takes a bit of effort behind the scenes; tending to the older content, keeping the "static" pages fresh, and removing any crud that's accumulated in the sidebars. Keep these things in order, while feeding in good content, and your blog will grow. At least, that's my theory. Things are slightly different on this particular blog, because it's a personal blog, not a topic blog - so growth isn't a primary concern. Hence the title: it can grow and be healthy, but I don't expect it to be big.

With all that said, what have I been up to?

### Site Theme

I decided [the new(ish) Twenty Thirteen WordPress theme](http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/twenty-thirteen/) just didn't work for me or how I see this site. It was nice and colourful, and good to have as a change, but it wasn't really "me." Instead, I've switched back to the "Standard" theme (which has been "retired" it seems), with a few tweaks. It's more structured, and described as a "meticulously designed, hand-crafted theme." I like things to have a bit of craftsmanship to them, and within that show an element of "control"; Twenty Thirteen felt just a little too chaotic for my tastes. I may still adjust some small parts, but mostly I'm happy with things now.

### "Elsewhere" Links

For a while now I've maintained a sidebar list of other places you can find me: social media, profiles on various sites, etc. I've tidied this up to remove services I no longer use, or don't use frequently enough for you to bother with. The  four sites in the sidebar now represent the other places you can find me, that *I care about*. Apart from Google+... not many people really care about that one, and I'm no different (maybe one day). Google+ is there to maintain my [authorship information in Google](http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/authorship/index.html).

### Pruning Dead Content

Last year I would cross-post a lot of my Instagram shots over here. Then I deleted my Instagram account, and all those photo posts started showing as broken images. I've finally got round to clearing them out. I may have missed one or two, so if you spot one, please let me know!

### Consolidation

Over the last couple of years I got it into my head that my blog had to present a "professional" image. An employer (or potential employer) might read it and decide not to hire me based on something I posted. As a result I fragmented my personality across the web, using a different site or service to post content in tailor-made silos. This site was just for technical posts which would show my expertise and how "professional" I am.

It was a stupid idea. It was stressful to maintain, and not as enjoyable. As a result, each site would languish for months without any update, and anything I did post was as much out of guilt as anything. I've given up trying to manage these sites, or "reboot" them. From now, this site represents the one "true" me. If an employer isn't going to hire me over, say, one of the hobbies I've written about on my blog, then chances are they're not somewhere I'd be happy to work at.

I will still use some services for specific needs: Twitter for things too short to fit here, and quick conversations; Facebook or Flickr for sharing photos of the kids with family or close friends, etc. Anything else should end up here. I've already imported the content of some other blogs into the archives, and I'm picking through an export of my old Tumblr, to see if there's anything there worth adding (not likely!).

### Re-Injecting the Personal and the Personality

Directly related to what I've written above, it struck me when I was reading through [the old posts I recovered](/blog/a-little-more-for-you-to-read/) from previous incarnations of this blog, was how *personal* I used to get on here. That has been missing for a few years now, and as a result, a lot of the personality and "voice" has gone. Somewhere along the line I became overly private and cautious about what I was posting, and I honestly don't know or understand why any more. It can't just have been the employer reason mentioned above. Did I think I would be seen as some sort of narcissist? This is something I will try to address going forward. I'm also thinking about addressing it going back too. There are large gaps in this blogs chronology which could easily be filled with retrospective and back-dated entries about what was going on at the time. Some of it could even be quite useful for myself, as a way to reflect.

I'm not 100% certain though. While it could end up OK, I don't want to post something inaccurate because my memories of the events have been tinged or faded by time. Especially where there's other people involved. It's OK to make a mistake about something just about me, but it's not OK when it could impact or upset someone else.

I have made a baby-step of a start though. I have added some photo galleries to the site. Most were taken in the last year, but I'll be going back and picking out other suitable subjects/events to post up. Galleries are backdated to the event/date they were taken, to distinguish "old" ones from any I post in the future. There will be a mix of subjects, from holidays, random photo-shoots, modelling projects... whatever really!

### What Next?

Going through this exercise ties-in to some thoughts I've been having recently about my "digital identity," who controls it, and what it means. These thoughts inn turn, have spun out of [me stepping away from Facebook for a while](/blog/forget-deleting-even-deactivating-your-facebook-account-can-be-difficult/ "Forget Deleting: Even Deactivating Your Facebook Account Can Be Difficult"). I'm trying to shape these thoughts into something fully-formed so I can share them on here.
