TLDR; I've switched from an [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone "iPhone") 5 to a [Google Nexus 4](http://www.google.com/nexus/4/ "Nexus 4").

OK, so I'm behind on the times a bit. The Google Nexus 4 has been out for several months, and I'd paid it no heed. I've been chugging along with my bought-at-launch iPhone 5 in that time, and barely paid the Nexus any thought. I read the reviews, and concluded it was a great Android phone, but I had no wish to rush out and buy one.

Then something strange happened.

I'm not sure why, but I got disenchanted with my iPhone. I never had that with my 4S, or 3G/3GS, despite the 5 being - in every way - better than all of them. Once that feeling settled in all the little niggles started to grate[^1]. The easily chipped and scratched aluminium casing (as gorgeous as it is to look at); the way the sharper edges of the back felt in my hand; the random network-stack drop-outs; the hoops you sometimes need to jump through to share files/data from one app to the next; the keyboard that seemed to miss random presses, and _still_ took me longer to type on than I could on my 4S (where I could at times type whole messages without looking at the screen).

I caught myself checking out other phones in the stores. Clearly it was time for the iPhone and I to "take a break".

I looked at Windows Phones, but decided there wasn't enough there to make it last. Blackberry? Err, no. That left Android.

I have a history with Android. I bought the [HTC Desire HD](http://www.htc.com/www/product/desirehd/overview.html "HTC Desire HD") on pre-order, as it had been loudly proclaimed "King of the Hill" at the time. Before it was even in my hands its crown usurped by (I think) the Galaxy S. We had some fun times, but I could never get along with the Sense UI. I rooted and flashed the phone, trying ROM after ROM. The experience was akin to installing Linux on an early Centrino laptop (anyone who tried it, back in c.2002-2003 will know what I mean) - where a feature worked, it worked very well... but only if you could live with the unsupported stuff. In the end, as much as I enjoyed parts of Android, I ended back in the warm embrace of iPhone.

Anyway, as I was saying, Android seemed the obvious choice, but which phone? I immediately gave up any notion of trying to get a phone that would be top of the specs pile for more than a few weeks[^2]. I also ruled out those ridiculous "Phablets" like the Galaxy Note 2. The recent HTC phones look brilliant, but they're still packing Sense. Sony's Xperia line look distinct, but seemed to come with another GUI skin and a load of unneeded apps. Samsung... well I've never had a good experience with Samsung's phone build quality, and they have the TouchWiz skin[^3]... lets just say I ruled them out quickly. There's the also-rans, but I was keen to get a phone that would get at least a few regular OS updates in its time.

I think I'd initially dismissed the Nexus because there was nowhere locally I could find one to try it out. Eventually I found somewhere with a display model, but I still couldn't test it because the security system used by the store blocked most of the screen. In the end (after a couple of weeks mulling it over) I went ahead and ordered one through the Play store anyway[^4]. A little over 24h later and the phone arrived.

First impressions were good. The unboxing experience was nice, and the first switch-on and setup was very fast. Within a few minutes my phone was syncing all of my Google services. If you use Google apps, then the experience is very, very smooth - everything "just works". Contacts, Calendars, GMail, Google+, Picassa, YouTube, Music... all setup with just one login during start-up. I had some data issues with contacts and calendars, due to the way I had my iPhone setup, but that's the subject of another post.

Of all the apps I regularly used on my iPhone (a decreasing amount recently), the only one I haven't don't have is Everpix, but I can keep using that one on my iPad Mini. Everything else either had an Android version - even my banking apps[^5] - or a suitably good equivalent (Falcon Pro instead of Tweetbot, for example).

Android itself has come a long, long way since I last used it. Jelly Bean is amazingly well polished, and the experience is very smooth. Coming from an iPhone, things do take a while to adjust to. I've found myself missing notifications on the lock screen, and application badges as indicators of which app just beeped at me. This is something I'll get used to I guess.

If I can get round to it I'll post a more comprehensive look at the Nexus 4, but for now I've not had it long enough to form more than first impressions. What I will definitely write-up is some of the experiences of moving my data from iOS/iCloud into Android/Google.

[^1]: These are all anecdotal, and in no way intended to imply they are common issues, or even that they're not "all in my head"
[^2]: I think by now, in the age of quad-core CPUs and multi-GB RAM that Smartphone specs are _good enough_ for most tasks they need to do.
[^3]: What _is_ it with Android OEMs and custom GUI skins?
[^4]: I recommend going this route. Despite the £10 delivery charge, it's at least £150 cheaper than buying at a retail store.
[^5]: I wasn't too impressed by one of them insisting I needed to install anti-virus on my mobile...
