A few weeks back I caved and bought the _Battle for Azeroth_ expansion for _World of Warcraft_. No, that's not why I didn't blog much in the last 2 weeks of September. Anyway, I played it heavily for the first few days I had it; I leveled my "main" (a Human Protection Paladin) to level 120 _very_ quickly. Surprisingly quickly in fact. I just followed the quest chains, and by the end of my first session I was already at 116 or so. By the end of the weekend I was at 118, and with a couple of hours mid-week, I was at max level. In Legion, using similar play patterns, it took me a couple of weeks to reach 110.

In general, levelling and questing through the new zones has been wonderful. There's always a new storyline to discover, and the atmosphere of the zones themselves has been amazing. I only fell to my death off the side of that mountain in Drustvar once twice three times.

I'm about halfway through [the "free" game time](/blog/quick-thoughts-on-returning-character-experience-vs-new-in-world-of-warcraft/) I had for WoW, and I'm probably going to resub for [at least another 6 months](https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/world-of-warcraft/22514561/celebrate-international-talk-like-a-pirate-day-in-style). A lot has been made on forums/Reddit/YouTube about "Beta for Azeroth" and the general quality of the systems in the expansion, but honestly? **I'm having a blast**.

Granted, I'm not your usual modern WoW player. I'm more interested in the solo experience and I'm only logging in a couple of times a week at most. The "time-gating" and Azerite armour issues many players are complaining about simply don't apply to me. I hated World Quests when I first unlocked them in Legion, but for some reason I'm really enjoying them in BfA. I log in, check my map to see what WQs have the best rewards (gear or rep tokens are my targets right now), and knock out 4-8 in short order. If I have time, I then carry on any questlines I'm working on. If a Warfront is open, I'll jump on the several quests available for that - the rewards and drops have been pretty good for me so far for a handful of "kill 20 of X" quests.

My goals in the game, in rough order right now, are: to get the Pathfinder achivements in [Legion](https://www.wowhead.com/broken-isles-pathfinder-flying-guide) and [BfA](https://www.wowhead.com/battle-for-azeroth-pathfinder-how-to-unlock-flying-in-bfa), unlock [WoD flying](https://www.wowhead.com/draenor-pathfinder-guide), then start unlocking Allied Races. Whenever I need a break from that I'm experimenting with how far I can get soloing Dungeons and Raids. I went into Legion's [Emerald Nightmare](https://www.wowhead.com/the-emerald-nightmare) (Normal) with ~ilvl 290 gear and soloed everything upto Ursoc with only a few deaths along the way. Those deaths were mostly on Elerethe, which I put down to unfamiliarity with the mechanics. I can get Ursoc to between 8%-15% remaining health fairly consistently, but I seem to be just short of getting over the finishing line before the debuffs get too much. I'll try again after a few gear upgrades. I even tried Trial of Valor before that (I had a quest), but - while I was in little danger of dying - the length of time it would take to down the first bosses was impractical. My hands started to cramp up after 15 minutes or so, with me, Hymdall and Hyrja all still above 70%, so I [bubble-hearthed](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Bubble_Hearth) out of there.

I'll get them eventually. It's just a matter of time.
