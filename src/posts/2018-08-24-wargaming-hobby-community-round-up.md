[Warhammer Conquest](http://www.warhammer40000conquest.com/) was a big topic of conversation this week. Knotley has two excellent posts [breaking down the cost](https://vincentknotley.wordpress.com/2018/08/20/speculative-look-warhammer-40000-conquest/) and [value](https://vincentknotley.wordpress.com/2018/08/22/warhammer-40000-conquests-rumoured-value/). I've subscribed, at least for now. Â£32 per month, to have something delivered regularly might actually help me cut down on impulse purchases. Plus, more Marine bodies and paints are always welcome. And there's an exclusive Primaris Lieutenant/Sergeant with issue 5 that I really want to get.

Warboss Kurgan had some excellent [Endless Spell conversions](https://warbosskurgan.blogspot.com/2018/08/endless-spells-of-harrowmark-part-2.html) to show off, to fit his "Blanchitsu" style Age of Sigmar creations.

Meanwhile, Bear was showing off his lovely [Stardrake](https://minimusingofabear.wordpress.com/2018/08/20/stardrake/) and [Celestant Prime](https://minimusingofabear.wordpress.com/2018/08/21/celestial-prime/).

Over at The Aaronorium, [theactualcolin posted his Lord of Contagion](https://talesfromtheaaronorium.com/2018/08/23/dont-fear-the-plaguereaper/), which he hopes will do better in games, now it finally has some paint on it.

Iron Sleet have the first two battle reports from their amazing looking "Thorn Moons Crusade" collaborative narrative campaign. The conversions, painting, and story-telling are all first class, so I **_highly_** recommend you check out the reports from [the 7th Moon](https://ironsleet.com/2018/08/21/thorn-moons-crusade-7th-moon-wolves-at-the-gates-part-i/) and [15th Moon](https://ironsleet.com/2018/08/22/thorn-moons-crusade-15th-moon-x-marks-the-moon/). Then read everything in the archive. Also at Iron Sleet, [Migs talks about what's coming next](https://ironsleet.com/2018/08/24/the-maker-the-untold/) from him.

Dave at Quietly Raging is making some real-world inspired, very Imperial looking [Church Tanks](https://nerodine.blogspot.com/2018/08/church-tank-introduction.html). Yes, churches on tanks. He's only posted the inspiration on his blog for now, but if you follow him on social media, you'll probably have seen WIP pictures of a very gothic looking Baneblade.

Mordian 7th has finished an [Orlock gang and some characters](http://mordian7th.blogspot.com/2018/08/necromunda-house-orlock-gang-slate.html), for Necromunda.

Curis has posted some more of his Classic Citadel miniatures, this time [some](http://www.ninjabread.co.uk/aetius-owen-dracula-blandford-warriors-episodes-10-11-12/) [excellently painted](http://www.ninjabread.co.uk/aetius-owen-dracula-blandford-warriors-episodes-10-11-12/) ["Blandford Warriors" from 1988](http://www.ninjabread.co.uk/aetius-owen-dracula-blandford-warriors-episodes-10-11-12/). I was 5 when these were released. The Lions Rampant on the shield/tabard of Owen of Wales are probably my favourite bit of the 3 miniatures.

Tyler Mengal has some words on [using Cheat Sheets to keep you right](http://www.mengelminiatures.com/2018/08/wargaming-cheat-sheets.html). These are something I should definitely make more use of.

Sprews & Brews ponder on [what they'd like to see from the rumoured Battletome](https://spruesandbrews.com/2018/08/23/darkoath-unalligned-and-the-realm-of-chaos-what-we-would-like-to-see-in-a-new-battletome/) covering the various "The Lost and The Damned" factions in Age of Sigmar, i.e. Beastmen, Darkoath, Slaves to Darkness, and a host of other minor Chaos factions. Also over there is [part 2 of Dave's Legion of Nagash vlogs](https://spruesandbrews.com/2018/08/20/daves-legions-of-nagash-vlog-2/).

Part 4 of CadianShock's [guide to getting started with Astra Militarum](https://cadianshock.com/play-astra-militarum-getting-started/) has been posted. Fall in, Guardsman.

Pike's Miniature Painting and Bolter & Brush both posted some good "How To" videos, [on Mortarion](http://www.pikesminiaturepainting.com/2018/08/20/how-to-paint-mortarion-daemon-primarch/) and the [Lord Celestant](https://brushandboltgun.com/2018/08/22/video-how-to-paint-a-stormcast-eternals-lord-celestant/), respectively.

Frontline Gaming have an article from (the world's only?) professional Warhammer 40,000 player, Nick Nanavati, about [studying smarter, not harder](https://www.frontlinegaming.org/2018/08/20/study-smarter-not-harder-nick-nanavati-1/), to avoid "gotcha" moments in games.

Finally, [Forge World rolled out some big changes to pricing and shipping](https://www.warhammer-community.com/2018/08/22/21st-aug-faster-shipping-better-service-todayfw-homepage-post-1/). In the UK, this generally means cheaper, faster, shipping. The [reaction](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/99ioh0/it_keeps_getting_deleted_off_facebook/) from those outside of the UK has been [far from happy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/99lpkd/someone_posted_this_on_fws_facebook_page/) though, as the faster shipping has been offset by 15-40% price increases in some cases.

That's all for this week. Did you find this round-up useful? Should I make them a regular thing? Let me know in the comments, and share this post with your friends ?
