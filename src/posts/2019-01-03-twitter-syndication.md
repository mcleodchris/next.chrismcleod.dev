I'm still geting used to the ins-and-outs of writing and syndicating content. So far it seems that:

- If there's no title, Brid.gy posts the contents of the post, with link to the original if specified
- If there is a title, that is used as the content of the link
- @-mentions and tags need to be added into whichever text Brid.gy will use for the tweet. I'd really like it if any tags could be pulled from links marked `u-category`, as space allows.

Photos tagged with the class `u-photo` will be attached to the tweet (up to four). I've added something to my theme's `functions.php` to automatically add this to all photos by default, and I'll remove it from any I don't want to share.

Right now, I'm not syndicating by default, and I don't think I will turn this on either. I like having the control; the only posts I'm likely to want to tweet out are my hobby-related entries.
