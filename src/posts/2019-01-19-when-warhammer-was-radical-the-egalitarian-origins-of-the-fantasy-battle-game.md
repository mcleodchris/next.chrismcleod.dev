There’s some seriously cool and interesting deep cuts of [Games Workshop and Warhammer history in this article](https://wearethemutants.com/2019/01/14/when-warhammer-was-radical-the-egalitarian-origins-of-the-fantasy-battle-game/).

While I don’t fully agree with the author’s characterisation of the current state of things, I do wish the company would do more; that it was still radical with how it portrays cultures and diversity in the settings and models. I get that it’s harder to take those bold stands when you’re a multi-national, publicly traded company worth hundreds of millions of pounds, but Games Workshop didn’t get to where it is by being timid in the first place.
