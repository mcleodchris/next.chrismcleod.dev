For the last 24-18 months or so I've had a background project to recreate my original [Adepta Sororitas](https://mrkapowski.com/tag/adepta-sororitas) (nee: "[Sisters of Battle](https://mrkapowski.com/tag/sisters-of-battle)") army, in advance of the new codex and plastic release. With that release looking more and more [imminent](/blog/amalia-novena/), I really need to get my skates on! By my reckoning I've got roughly three months to finish up, maybe less!

The original army was purchased by fourteen year-old me on release day in 1997. I'd saved up my paper round money for several weeks to afford it, after falling in love with what had been previewed in White Dwarf the month before. It's a tiny army by modern standards (roughly 545 points in a Patrol Detachment), but it was a decent sized force in Second Edition, and I loved playing it. Anyway, to cut a long story short, the army was given away by my mum a few years later, once I'd moved out for university and had fallen out of the hobby. [Since coming back to the fold](/blog/on-returning-to-warhammer-40000-the-game/), it's been the one army I've really regretted not having any more.

I've already collected and painted the two Sororitas character models from the original army - a Canoness and Standard Bearer (now called an Imagifier), and I've started painting the two squads I've acquired so far: a ten-woman Battle Sister squad, and five Seraphim. I also need to paint a banner for the Standard Bearer, to truly finish it off. Long-time readers will know [I have finished painting some Battle Sister squads](/blog/completed-order-of-the-eternal-saint-for-painthammer2019/) this year, but those were bought to bulk the collection up to a "full size" Eighth Edition army, and aren't part of the core project.

There's still a five-strong Retributor squad to get hold of, but the problem I have here is I can't for the life of me remember exactly what I armed them with twenty-two years ago! I'm pretty sure it was four of one weapon type - either Multi-Meltas or Heavy Flamers - but given the time period it could well have been a mix of all three. I think I'm going to go with four Heavy Flamers, as I remember I painted at least one of these "back in the day," and I'm certain it wasn't for the Battle Sister squad (which had a Heavy Bolter). Plus, I've never really liked the "Sabbat" helmet shown on some of the Sisters models, which is why I'm reasonably sure it wasn't the Multi-Meltas.

When I started the project I knew that some of the models were going to be really hard to get hold of in a usable condition, and for a reasonable price. While many are still available from Games Workshop, several are long out of print: namely the Canoness, Standard Bearer, Immolator, and an "Imperial Missionary with Plasma Gun". Of these, I thought the Immolator was going to be the hardest to acquire, but I found one on Saturday. Now I just need to get the Missionary. They occasionally pop-up on eBay, but usually in a bad condition, _and_ for a higher price than I'm willing to pay for that condition. It wouldn't be the end of the world if I can't get hold of one at this time - it's no longer a game-legal choice, and I'm concentrating on the Sororitas - but it would be nice for completion's sake!

Got one of these to sell? Let me know!

So, roughly 21/22 models to paint in the next couple of months, with a currently unknown target date for completion? Sounds doable, right? Well, yeah, if you're not as slow a painter as me, and hadn't started a [Genestealer Cults army](/blog/genestealer-cults/) in the meantime which needs cleared from the painting desk‚Ä¶ If the codex is due in October, I'm reasonably confident I can make it; coming sooner and I'm less so. If anyone in the [Warhammer Community](https://www.warhammer-community.com/) team who might happen to read this wants to give me a subtle hint, that would be helpful! üòâ (Also, I'd love to write about the project as an article on the community site, once I have some more finished models to show off!)

With all that said, whether the new models are coming in 3 months, or 3 weeks, first I need to stock up on more Retributer Armour spray paint!
