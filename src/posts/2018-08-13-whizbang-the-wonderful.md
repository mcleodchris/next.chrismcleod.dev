I've started playing Hearthstone again, and it's entirely down to one card in the latest expansion: [Whizbang the Wonderful](https://kotaku.com/new-hearthstone-card-builds-its-own-crappy-deck-so-you-1827753650). As someone who has sat out the last several expansions, having a single card allow me to "catch up" and try decks I otherwise don't have the cards for is, well, _wonderful_! So much so I spent my saved dust to craft a golden copy. Good job, Blizzard!
