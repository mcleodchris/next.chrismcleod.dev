I've been running my own instance of [Aaron](https://aaronparecki.com/)â€™s excellent [Monocle microsub client](https://github.com/aaronpk/Monocle) for a while now. I think it's time I take the leap and run my own instance of [Aperture microsub server](https://github.com/aaronpk/Aperture) as well (and its [associated](https://github.com/aaronpk/Watchtower) [services](https://github.com/atmos/camo)), just so I don't have to rely on any services hosted elsewhere.

I just need to figure out if I need to give Aperture its' own server, rather than run it alongside everything else on my existing VM.
