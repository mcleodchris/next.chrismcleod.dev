I've been granted some WoW in-game time as a resolution to an old support ticket, so I'm able to jump onto my higher-level characters again. I'm comparing the experience to the one I had with [the new character I started earlier](/blog/hello-again-elwynn-forest/), and… hooo-boy the experience on my 110 Paladin was confusing. I stopped playing pretty early in Legion's lifecycle, so when I logged in I was prompted to do the Legionfall scenario straight away, then after 1 quest or so, I was immediately whisked off to start Argus. While I'm on my way to Argus, I'm prompted to start the Siege of Lordaeron, leaving me wondering what content is actually worth playing through. Playing the Siege would net me a shiny new weapon, but no way to follow up on that storyline until I drop £40-£53 on Battle for Azeroth.

On top of the questing confusion, all my talents were reset and my abilities changed. These were expected, but it adds to the sense of unfamiliarity. I'm not a fan of the GCD change and how it affects Paladin rotation, but that might just be a symptom of generally feeling lost. Right now I feel like I'm just mashing random buttons whenever I get in combat, in the hope something fires off.  On a character I've played on-and-off for 11ish years, feeling lost is very uncomfortable and frustrating!

I guess I'm in an odd position in that I'm coming back after a new expansion is released, but I haven't unlocked the new content yet. In general the experience seems to be that while _new_ characters get guided to where they need to be, _returning_ characters [need to figure out for themselves](https://reddit.com/r/wow/comments/99vbfp/i_am_an_idiot/) what they're meant to be playing through, with the implication that you will just drop anything "old" from your Quest Log immediately. But there's nothing to tell you in-game what is out-dated. In my case, for _this_ character, the path forward is pretty much "buy BFA and forget about anything Legion-related," but if I'd been returning at some point around the pre-patch, with no clue as to what had been released since I stopped playing, I would have been completely disorientated.

[Maybe I'll just stick with a new character for now](/blog/hello-again-elwynn-forest/)…
