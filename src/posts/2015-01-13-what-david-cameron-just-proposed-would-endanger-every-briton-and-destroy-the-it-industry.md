[Cory Doctorow on the scary rhetoric](http://boingboing.net/2015/01/13/what-david-cameron-just-propos.html) coming from the Conservative Prime Minister, just before the next General Election:

> David Cameron [says there should be no "means of communication" which "we cannot read"](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30778424) -- and no doubt many in his party will agree with him, politically. But if they understood the technology, they would be shocked to their boots.

Every time I hear senior politicians talking about technology (usually in the contextÂ of "security" and "safety") it becomes clear they really don't know what they're talking about.
