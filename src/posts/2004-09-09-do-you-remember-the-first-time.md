**\[Editors Note\]** This was the first post on my Pixel Meadow blog, but obviously _not_ my first ever blog entry.

> Writing your first line is hard. From English classes to blogs, everyone has struggled to write the opening sentence. This short entry recognises that fact and pays tribute; looking back at how others have started before me.

Writing the first line is the hardest part of the writing process. Remember back in school? You could sit for hours trying to come up with the opening sentence for the essay your English teacher wanted in the following morning. The rest of the essay was always easy by comparison.

It was the same with that love letter you wrote to your sweetheart; the first line in your million-dollar film script; the first post in your blog and every post after.

I was curious to what other writers had put in the first posts on their blogs.[Dan@SimpleBits](http://www.simplebits.com/) [alludes to an older version of his blog](http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2000/09/01/september_1_2000.html) and how this one will be different. [So does](http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2002/11/08/inaugural_po/) [David@Mezzoblue](http://www.mezzoblue.com/). [Jon Hicks](http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/) [welcomes you to his lab](http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/7/it-won8217t-shake-the-earth8230).[Dunstan](http://www.1976design.com/blog/) wrote [about Paris](http://www.1976design.com/blog/archive/2003/08/). “First Post!” is [all Michael had to say](http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2002/05/31/first-post/). Others[humbly welcome you to their blog](http://www.stopdesign.com/log/2002/08/19/something_new.html) and explain [why they’ve started writing](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200303/its_a_start/). I nearly joined them. Some write to share information, others [write to get better at writing](http://www.dkeithrobinson.com/asterisk/archive/2002/07/virgin).

This entry is a tribute. At least, I’d like to think so. A tribute to the first line; the opening sentence; the first post. I’d like you to think back to where you started from. That mountain of effort that started your blog. Share what it was like.

Welcome to my first post.
