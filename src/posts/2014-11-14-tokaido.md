My girlfriend and I were watching the [first episode of new series of Tabletop](http://youtu.be/pipFRzGYgdk) yesterday, which introduced us to a [board game called Tokaido](http://www.funforge.fr/US/?portfolio=tokaido).

Almost immediately we both agreed it was an amazingly beautiful game. I could quite happily frame the board itself to display. The illustrator, Xavier Gueniffey-Durin, has done an amazing job.

The game play of Tokaido seemed to be that winning combination of simple to learn, but with enough depth to make it a challenge to master.

Maybe I should buy two copies - one to frame the artwork, and the other to play? Or one to give to my sister, as I think the art would be right up her street.
