Since last year I’ve made a point that whenever I feel a bit "neurofunky", I try to do something to invest in myself. The last few days have been _a thing_ so I’ve planned the pathways to my next certification(s), and set myself up with some of the resources I’ll need to get there.

Right now, the plan is to complete the following exams over the next 6 weeks:

- Azure Data Fundamentals (DP-900)
- Power Platform Fundamentals (PL-900)
- Azure AI Fundamentals (AI-900)

At least 2 of those topics are pretty much brand new to me, so it’s going to be an interesting time…

I've already booked the exams, to give myself a set timeframe and deadline for each. My employer offers vouchers towards taking these exams, so it doesn't cost me anything over and above the time and effort investments. Even if the exams hadn't been free, then I'd have probably booked at least one of these (or maybe more, just spread out over months rather than weeks)

So we'll see how it goes. I'm excited to learn some new things, but I am conscious I'm going to be under a bit of stress due to the timing.
