I've just posted the first post on [The Underground](https://theunderground.blog/) for the New Year; you'll need to be subscribed to[ the RSS feed](https://theunderground.blog/feed.xml) to read the full thing, but I wanted to share my favourite part of the post here, for posterity:

> An aside: I hesitate to air the nostalgia reason; a lot of the current [resurgence](https://www.anildash.com/2024/01/03/human-web-renaissance/) of the small/indie/open web is driven by [a nostalgia](https://joanwestenberg.medium.com/i-miss-the-internet-c7e41544a8b9) for [what we had](https://www.anildash.com/2012/12/13/the_web_we_lost/) before, and ultimately I'd like us collectively to move past that nostalgia and start imagining new ways of using the web on a personal level.

> I can't deny there is an element of nostalgia driving this desire to do more with my own website. Way, way, way back… back before we standardised on blogs, I had a website and it was a melting pot of *everything* I was interested in; it was a miniature "hub" online for me and my "IRL" friends (one of several hubs we used, all run by someone we knew in person). There was a feature where people could leave messages for each other. Meetups were arranged in the comments. If I decided I wanted to experiment with using maths to drive Adobe Flash animations, well I guess now there's a new gallery page for that. Photo dumps of nights out before we started using Facebook for that purpose - before Facebook existed, even! Reviews of local band gigs that were as much about promoting those bands and venues as anything else, because I was in love with that world and wanted to share it… in short: anything I could think about putting online I experimented with doing so. Some of it didn't work and got pulled down again quickly, and most of it would almost certainly make me cringe now - but isn't that part of the point of being young? To embarrass your older self with how carefree you were?

> Now, I accept the world and I are very different in 2024 to how we were in 1999-2002, so it will never be exactly the same. But the ethos still clings to me. I still believe - even if my aging memory needs reminded and pushed into action - that our websites could and should be a reflection of everything we want to share about ourselves. Your website *could* be your central hub on the web, instead of one part in a network of profiles across dozens of sites. It could be something so deeply *you*, that even though you post prolifically in many places, it's your website people remember about and read first.
