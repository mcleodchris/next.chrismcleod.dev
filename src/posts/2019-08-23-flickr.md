Cool. Sometime recently, [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/) migrated their signup process to their own native system. I've been curious about Flickr under its new owners, but as recently as a couple of months ago, signing up still required creating a Yahoo account -- something there was zero chance of me doing.

I'm not sure what I'd use Flickr for nowadays, but I do have fond memories of the service in its heyday of the mid-2000s. I can syndicate from this site to [my Flickr photostream](https://www.flickr.com/people/mrkapowski), although that means I'll probably have to start using the full-sized original images in posts instead of the resized versions I use currently.
