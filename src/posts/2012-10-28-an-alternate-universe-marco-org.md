[An alternate universe – Marco.org](http://www.marco.org/2012/10/26/an-alternate-universe "An alternate universe – Marco.org")

Sounds quite a lot like the experience in just about any high-street Electronics store in the UK, but with better décor. Although I rarely buy in an Apple store (shocking, I know!), I prefer their hands-off approach – let the customer explore the product on their own, and be on hand if they have any questions. "Hard sells" are really off-putting. If it's good enough, your product will sell itself.
