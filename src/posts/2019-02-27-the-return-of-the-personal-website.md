[Let Sleeping Blogs Die (or) The Return of the Personal Website](https://joshuablankenship.com/2019/02/22/let-sleeping-blogs-die-or-the-return-of-the-personal-website/)

> “I don’t know much, but I know I love you I know I miss 2004 web, personal websites, and curation that has nothing to do with algorithms. And maybe you do, too. So here we are, dusting off the URL, like a baby Blankenphoenix rising from the ashes of 27,000 deleted Viagra comments.”

Missing the spirit of 2004-era blogging is one reason I started this blog after letting my previous long-running blog wither away from neglect. Welcome back Joshua! I've (re)added your site to my feed reader ?
