What's up wit' dat? :)

Another thing that I forgot to mention, that I actually meant to post last night (but w.bloggar was playing up on my desktop) - found a kickass program for doing CG (Computer Generated) artwork.

OpenCanvas ([http://www.portalgraphics.net](http://www.portalgraphics.net)) combines some really wonderful natural media type brushes, with some basic photoshop functionality (layers, et al). This may not sound very different to, Painter, for example... well that's cos it isn't. However, I found Painter quite hard to get to grips with and hard to understand. Plus, it costs a bomb. OpenCanvas may not have as many options or features, but it's simple, fast (takes up next to no space), intuitive and above all, it's cheap. If you hunt around, you can still find the v1.1 release, which is free. Current official version is 2.24e. Interesting features include network co-operative work (multiple people can work on a piece at the same time) and the ability to record your progress for later playback. Handy for creating tutorails, etc.

So if you like CGing and were looking for a tool to add that natural look that you were after, give it a try :)
