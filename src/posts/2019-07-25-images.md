I've just generated a [webp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/) version of every image file I've ever uploaded to this site, with the intent to [add a redirect](https://docs.ewww.io/article/16-ewww-io-and-webp-images) for browsers which support the format - [that should be most, nowadays](https://caniuse.com/#search=webp). I haven't done the redirect yet, but I'll turn that on later.

I also took the opportunity to fix a whole bunch of missing thumbnails and missing sizes for my images. A previous mishap on my part meant there were a lot of these missing. [WP-CLI](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/media/regenerate/) didn't seem to work for me, but there's an easy (although repetitive and boring) way to do this through the library:

- Open the image
- Click "Edit Image"
- Flip the image, then flip it again
- Save

So hopefully that's any broken images fixed, and soon, speedier and more optimised versions will be served.
