I’m trying to wrap my head around the [#indieweb approach](https://indieweb.org/why), and thinking about how it could be applied to my site, and more importantly, I’m trying to figure out how _I_ would want it to work for me:

- If I post a short post type (<280 chars), it automatically gets [syndicated](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) fully to Twitter, including any attached media. [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/mrkapowski) would also be good.
- Any interactions with that Tweet are reflected on the original post.
- “Pure” indieweb philosphy would have me reply to any/all tweets from my site, but I’m not sure I want to go there.
- Other [social media “silos”](https://indieweb.org/silo) should similarly interact with the site in a push or pull manner as appropriate - e.g. if I post to Instagram, the photo should be converted into a new post on my site, with the file rehosted.
- The site should essentially be the “hub” for everything I post online, including a “profile” of sorts.
- [Microformats and POSH](http://microformats.org/wiki/posh) should be a given.
- Longer posts should still be first-class citizens.
- Post titles are completely optional and the tools involved should handle this gracefully.
- Different post types should have distinct/appropriate visual styling.

Oh, and all of this should work as easily and seamlessly as possible on iOS (my primary platform)

Right now, I’m trying to get this setup using [Wordpress with several of the recommended IndieWeb plugins](https://indieweb.org/WordPress) and recommendations, but so far I’m struggling to get things “just so.” The site definitely feels very rough around the edges. I’m not tied to this current approach though. Ideally I’d like to stick with tools/languages I know, and not need to spend weeks configuring things.

In an ideal world, I could have integrated the IndieWeb tooling/approach into my existing blog, which is powered by Jekyll - but this currently fails my "easy to do on iOS" test, which is the main reason I've not blogged there in around six months.
