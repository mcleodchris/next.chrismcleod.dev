In 2017 I'm trying to be be a bit more privacy and security-minded when using the web (on all devices). I've been increasingly interested in these areas for a few years, and especially since the Snowden revelations, and recent events like the [IP Bill](https://boingboing.net/2016/11/23/uks-new-surveillance-law-cre.html), aka the "[Snoopers Charter](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/ip-bill-law-details-passed)," in the UK have pushed me further towards them. Over the next few weeks I'm going to look into (and try to document here) various things I can do to increase my security, decrease the amount of information applications and services can collect on me, and generally "take back control" of my online privacy.

I work in the tech industry, I'm fairly conscious about this stuff, and understand a few of the elements and technologies, but it's really a very basic understanding. What I do know might be out of date. At this stage it might be too little too lateâ€¦ right now I don't really know.

**Upfront**: I fully recognise that if the police/MI5/NSA/FSB/whoever _really_ wanted my data, nothing I could do would be able to stop them.

**Also upfront**: even with that in mind, whatever I put in place won't be considered "perfect." What I'm looking to do is balance convenience, practicality, and security. If something is too difficult or fiddly to use, it will end up not being used.

Thinking specifically about the IP Bill, [far too many agencies for my liking](https://yiu.co.uk/blog/who-can-view-my-internet-history/) will have complete, unfettered access to what I get up to on the internet. Beyond that one example, the amount of web ad trackers we have to contend with nowadays is snowballing, as are the services amassing data to pay for those "free" apps we enjoy.

While it might be that none of these data collectors have nefarious purposes in mind (if you're trusting), data security breaches are becoming bigger and more frequent. Data being stored is likely to leak or be stolen at some point, so the best you can hope for is to limit the amount of potentially harmful data[^1] being held.

On a lighter note, here's a great spoof from Cassetteboy about the IP Bill

So all this is a bit of a long-winded preamble to saying look out for the future posts where I talk about what I have learned, how I'm applying it, any recommendations I have, and how you can do the same. The first post on some of the basics, and links to reading materials will be coming today/tomorrow. In the meantime, are there any tips or good sources you've come across? Feel free to share in the comments.

[^1]: Insert definition of what you would consider "harmful data if leaked".
