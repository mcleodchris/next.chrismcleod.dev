Seriously.

After last weeks _amazing_, high-octane episode 4 (write-ups can be found at Binary Bonsai[1](https://web.archive.org/web/20061105184123/http://www.pixelmeadow.com/entries/2006/10/30/battlestar-galactica-stole-my-heart/#fn739918256454527eb47adc) and Broken Kode[2](https://web.archive.org/web/20061105184123/http://www.pixelmeadow.com/entries/2006/10/30/battlestar-galactica-stole-my-heart/#fn265870054454527eb4cdf4)), this week’s episode had to be something pretty good to keep up the levels of expectation.

Thankfully it lived up to the expectation without having to fall back to more space battles or other big action sequences. If anything, episode 5 was he perfect slow-down to the frenetic opening to the season.

We all knew the resistance were going to start dealing with any and all Cylon “collaborators”. We also knew this was going to end up being to cause a lot of friction and fucked up feelings as people found out their friends helped the enemy. The writers (once again) and actors pulled things off beautifully. We can feel the lust for retribution in every scene. It may have been a bit predictable[3](https://web.archive.org/web/20061105184123/http://www.pixelmeadow.com/entries/2006/10/30/battlestar-galactica-stole-my-heart/#fn884141231454527eb51851)having Gaeta sentenced to death, only to be saved at the last minute when it was revealed how he was passing information to the resistance all along, but we’ll forgive them that one.

And _damn_ Starbuck is one crazy-ass, fucked-up (frakked-up?) woman.

3 Similarly, my only real criticism of episode 4 was the predictable “Pegasus to the rescue” bit _just_ as the Galactica was about to go down. But hey, it looked good!
