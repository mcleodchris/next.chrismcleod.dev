I signed up to [Proton Mail](https://www.protonmail.com/) today, as the first step in a push to de-Googlefy[^1] myself, amongst other "[silo quits](https://indieweb.org/silo-quits)" I'm hoping to do this year. Email is a _very_ minor part of my online life, but it's part of the foundations, so it makes sense to move this first.

So begins the long process of switching over various accounts to use the new address. I'm not planning on switching everything - for example, I'll not use it for _anything_ social media related. A couple of important accounts have already switched, and apart from a few… oddities… as apps updated their cached details, these switches have gone smoothly enough.

[^1]: It won't be a complete removal, unfortunately… for a bunch of disperate but important reasons I'll need to keep the account open for the time being. Hopefully next year I can cut free entirely.
