The Raspberry Pi team have written up a nice how-to on hosting your own Mastodon instance on a Raspberry Pi 4B. Theirs is hosted in the cloud, but I imagine you could adapt the steps to use your own Pi at home - it would probably be simpler as you likely wouldn't need to jump through all of the IPv6 hoops they did.

After a lot of debate here at Pi Towers, we’ve now spun up [our own Mastodon instance](https://raspberrypi.social/@Raspberry_Pi). The best thing about it? It’s running on a Raspberry Pi 4 [hosted at Mythic Beasts](https://www.mythic-beasts.com/order/rpi/). Last time we talked about Mastodon, we told you why we were doing it. Today’s post talks about how you can join us._
