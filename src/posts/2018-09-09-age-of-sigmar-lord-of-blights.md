Earlier this year I painted up a Lord of Blights, from Warhammer: Age of Sigmar, for a local painting competition. I posted it all over social media at the time, but never got around to posting it here. So consider that oversight corrected!

The model was a joy to paint, one of my favourites in a while. I experimented with a few things on the skin, and I'm pretty happy how it turned out. I can't see a Nurgle army in my future, but if that ever changes, it will be painted in a similar palette.
