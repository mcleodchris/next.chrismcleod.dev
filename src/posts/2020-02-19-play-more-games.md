Last night, Mrs K. and I were at a loss for anything new to watch, and not in the mood to read or do anything hobbywise, we ended up rewatching several episodes of [Tabletop](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7atuZxmT956cWFGxqSyRdn6GWhBxiAwE).

First thing's first: gosh I miss that [show](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TableTop_(web_series)>). It was so simple, fun, and "pure".

Secondly: we couldn't believe it when YouTube was telling us the _newest_ of these videos was four years old. It really felt like just a year or two had passed.

Anyway. I was watching with a slightly different perspective than the first time through. At the weekend we had [played](/blog/10736/) [Munchkin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6oMBSiL7Zs) with one of the kids, and we all had a really good time**\***. I was looking for some more games to add to the collection, that would be friendly to young children, while still fun and appealing for the whole family… and preferably not take long to play through a game or a round.

The first candidates which met the criteria were [Roll For It and Sushi Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu9RB-N4T3g&list=PL7atuZxmT956cWFGxqSyRdn6GWhBxiAwE&index=21&t=0s), coveniently both played in the same episode. [Roll For It](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/129090/roll-it) has a simple premise: roll a number of dice, then try to match the values on a card to score the points on that card. [Sushi Go](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133473/sushi-go) is a brightly-coloured card game where players score points for "collecting" various dishes.

No longer having to deal with [The Wheaton Effect](https://web.archive.org/web/20120512000206/http://www.starlitcitadel.com/helm/2012/05/08/the-wheaton-effect/), both games were readily available for around £13 each. which made them good "impulse purchases".

It'll be a couple of weeks until we get to try these games with the kids, but I'm already looking forward to it. I love exposing them to new and different ways of spending their free time.

**\*** I don't think they really understood the game, or really read most of the cards, but they quickly developed a strategy of making monster fights harder for the other players before offering to _help_ them in exchange for some of the treasure.
