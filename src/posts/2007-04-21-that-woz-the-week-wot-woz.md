If you thought I’d maybe given up on this blog _already_ (what is it? A week?), I’m sorry to disappoint you. Truth is, I’ve been quite busy this week, with **lots** going on, here there and everywhere. Instead of splitting things into multiple posts for more page views, I’m going to run through everything in one go:

### 1\. Guitar Hero II Rocks

You may have seen some of the pictures on Flickr already, but I just want to say how genius [Guitar Hero II on Xbox 360](http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/guitarhero2/default.htm) is. The whole family has been rocking out all week. None of us are any good, but it’s part of the fun!

### 2\. My Company Bought Another Company

The management are saying “merger”, but the official legal term is “acquisition”. Either way, the company I work for is joining withanother company. This is quite interesting for me, because the other company (PGL) have a software development division. I need to have a chat with the management involved, but there’s certainly an opportunity for me to move into desktop application development instead of doing web stuff.

### 3\. I’ve Been Setting Up My Networked Media System

OK, that’s probably a fancier title than it needs, but basically I’ve been getting all the pieces in place to have all my media available to stream to the living room and bedroom. The system is mostly Mac based, with an Xbox 360 in the living room. For network connections I’m using [HomePlug AV](http://www.devolo.co.uk/uk_EN/produkte/dLAN/dlan200avsk.html) units - which so far have worked brilliantly. At the centre of everything will be a Mac Mini, an external hard drive, iTunes, and a copy of Vista media center running in a virtual machine. I’d have it up and running just now, but i picked up the wrong type of RAM for upgrading the mini… Doh!

### 4\. I’ve Been Running

Well, not so much as I’d have liked this week, but I’ve slowly been ramping up the milage in my quest to be ready for the Aberdeen 10K run in a months time. Gym sessions have been going great, and I’ve dropped a stone and a half in weight since I started, which is a bonus!

So there you have it; that woz the week wot woz. Quite a bit going on, which was a bit unusual for me. Everybody else been having a good week?
