[Binx has reviewed the new Age of Sigmar Champions](http://binxshobbyblog.co.uk/age-sigmar-champions-review) card game. I've never played a physical trading card game, though I have know plenty who play(ed) _Magic: The Gathering_. I already have one expensive hobby, so adding another one seemed like a bad idea! But the thing that interests me most about _Age of Sigmar Champions_, is that you automatically get a digital copy of every physical pack you buy, so you can play online. As someone who enjoys playing Hearthstone, it defiantly intrigues me!
