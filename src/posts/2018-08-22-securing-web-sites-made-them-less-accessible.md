Eric Meyer: [Securing Web Sites Made Them Less Accessible](https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2018/08/07/securing-sites-made-them-less-accessible/)

> In the middle of last month (July 2018), I found myself staring at a projector screen, waiting once again to see if Wikipedia would load.  If I was lucky, the page started rendering 15-20 seconds after I sent the request.

This is good insight from Eric. I'm a firm believer in HTTPS everywhere, but it's so easy to forget that HTTPS has many trade-offs… I forget the lack of caching all the time! I've been planning to set up a [service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/) to allow for a type of caching since this site went live, but I haven't yet found the time to learn about them enough that I can implement something. But as my "still to-do" list for this site is getting short, I should hopefully get around to adding it soon.
