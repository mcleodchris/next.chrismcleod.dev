A few days late with this one, but hey-hoâ€¦

[The Mozilla Foundation](https://web.archive.org/web/20041123003122/http://www.mozilla.org/ "Mozilla Foundation") released new milestones of three of its open source applications.

[The Mozilla Suite](https://web.archive.org/web/20041123003122/http://www.mozilla.org/releases/#1.5 "Mozilla Suite") - which contains an advanced, fast and robust web browser, a simple WYSIWYG HTML tool and a secure mail client is now up to version 1.5.

[Thunderbird](https://web.archive.org/web/20041123003122/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/ "Thunderbird Mail Client"), is a development of the mail client that comes with the Mozilla Suite. It contains many advanced features, such as intuitive anti-spam controls and is far more secure against viruses, worms and other such risks than Outlook Express. Thunderbird has now reached version 0.3.

[Firebird](https://web.archive.org/web/20041123003122/http://www.mozilla.org/products/firebird/ "The Firebird web browser"), is a development of the web browser found in the Mzilla suite. It is fast, robust and contains many highly useful and advanced features such as find-as-you-type (find links and text on a page, simply by typing. No fiddling with menu items), tabbed browsing and extensibility in the form of [extensions](https://web.archive.org/web/20041123003122/http://texturizer.net/firebird/extensions/ "Firebird Extensions, courtesy of Texturiser.net"). Firebird also offers a high degree of standards compliance.

I like Mozilla stuff. Firebird is my default browser and Thunderbird is my mail client. Both are highly capable (and, I reckon, far better) alternatives to Internet Explorer and Outlook Express. Go download now, you won't regret it!
