Never, ever pre-order games. That's the general rule, especially given such recent debacles as the PC version of Arkham Knight.

But as with every rule, there are exceptions. The final entry in the Starcraft 2 series is - for me - one of them. Within 20 minutes of learning [the pre-order for the digital editions was live](https://eu.battle.net/shop/product/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void), I had the deluxe edition ordered.

Starcraft is one of those rare gaming series I hold dear; I played the original on my very first PC, fell in love with the story, then had to wait *over a decade* until Starcraft 2 came along. When the first part, Wings of Liberty, arrived 12 years after Starcraft 1, I fell in love all over again, and all fears about how splitting up the game into 3 would work out. The 3 year wait for Heart of the Swarm was agonising -- I loved the story being told so much I just wanted more!

Now we're nearing the end, at last. The final chapter in the Starcraft saga will arrive sometime between now and March, and I can't wait.
