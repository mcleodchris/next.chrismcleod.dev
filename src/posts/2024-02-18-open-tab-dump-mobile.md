I had a *lot* of tabs open in Mobile Safari. It was kinda getting a bit overwhelming to have to scroll through them all to find a particular one, or if I already had something I was about to search for open.

So I figured I'd save a list of them all somewhere, just in case, and wipe the slate clean on my phone. The list below are the ones worth sharing. I even created an iOS Shortcut to help automate creating the list - so who knows, it might become a regular feature!
