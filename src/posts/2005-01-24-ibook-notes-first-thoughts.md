I’ve had my iBook for about 48 hours now, and I’m beginning to find my way. OS X (or is it OSX?) is a completely new experience to me, but I think I’m taking to it rather well. I’m still getting used to the difference between *shutting* an application and *quitting* an application, but that’ll come in time! For what it’s worth, I wanted to jot down my initial experiences and reactions with the switch. I won’t go into too much detail just yet – I’ll save that for later articles.

- File browsing is more intuitive, especially after I switched to column view in Finder.
- A lot more emphasis is placed on using keyboard commands than in Windows…
- …Which is just as well, as the trackpad is a bit pants.
- Software installation is a breeze. It’s so simple and logical. Drop the application into the applications folder and away you go!
- I’m still not sold on the Dock, but I haven’t done any tweaking yet (other than the size of it)
- Everything just looks better. From the icons to the text to the GUI widgets… it’s just *better*!

So far, I haven’t done anything to set up the machine for local development/testing. I plan to do this later this week, after I’ve done a bit more reading – I want to set up SVN and Ruby/Rails, both of which I’ve never set up before (or even used before, in the case of Ruby/Rails!). Another thing that I haven’t done yet, is transferred any old files onto the iBook. That’s tonight’s job.
