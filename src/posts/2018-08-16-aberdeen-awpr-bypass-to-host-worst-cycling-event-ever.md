> The new Aberdeen Western Peripheral Road (AWPR) is to host a “Go North East Road Festival” before it is opened to traffic in September. The event will offer cyclists an opportunity to “wobble or weave” on the road to promote active travel. However, people will not be allowed to bring their own bikes “for everyone’s safety” and cyclists will be banned from the road forever once the event is over.

Who honestly thought this would be a good idea? To "promote cycling," people will have to leave their own bikes at home and take a shuttle bus. When the AWPR opens in September, cyclists will be banned from it.

It's really not a good look for the entire region…
