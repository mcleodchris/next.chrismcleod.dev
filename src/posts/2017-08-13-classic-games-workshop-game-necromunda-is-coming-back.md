Flyers handed out at the [Forge World Open Day 2017](https://www.warhammer-community.com/2017/08/13/forge-world-open-day-live-blog/) have teased the new version of the game, called _Necromunda: Underhive_.

_Necromunda_ was one of my favouurite Games Workshop games ever, so to see it return makes today a happy day. Hopefully thereâ€™s something analogous to the original cardboard + plastic scenery comes with the new game.
