... I’ve never, ever, visited [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/) and I think I’ve only played [one video I’ve found on a blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20061105184103/http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2006/10/05/the-terminator-vs-robocop-vs/).

Does that make me a bad person?

But seriously, what is the big deal with YT?
