[Crappy Computers](http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2012/11/04/crappy_computers/ "ignore the code: Crappy Computers")

Should we invert the conventional wisdom that "casual" or non-technical users only need bottom-spec'ed technology? Personally I'd always argue for "buy the best/highest spec you can afford", based on the idea itÂ *should* last you longer, no matter your relative technical abilities or needs. "You get what you pay for" springs to mind.
