Found a nice, interesting piece [about weblogs and how they are an indicator of how most media has been opened up to amateurs, by technology](https://web.archive.org/web/20041121170046/http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2003/09/weblogs_and_the_mass_amateurisation_of_nearly_everything.shtml "(Weblogs and) The Mass Amateurisation of (Nearly) Everything...").

A lot of good points are made, though the auther tends to over-simplify a fair bit. A lot of the comments are excellent too, giving the article even more credibility as a discussion point.
