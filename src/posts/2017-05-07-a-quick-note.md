I've not written much here since the start of the year. I'd started off with such good intentions. This isn't one of those "sorry I haven't been posting" blog posts, so don't worry. I don't apologise for it… it is what it is.

What's happened is my brain has been mainly filled with three things the last few months: work, politics, and hobby. I don't want to write about politics, not really, though it's definitely something I could provide a running commentary on (this might please my Twitter followers most, if I were move politics to here). Work… well it's work - I've been doing my best to keep it at the office, as it's been very intense of late. There's been a few very interesting technical challenges I could write about, but I can't go into some of the specifics necessary, due to the nature of what I do. Plus, normally by the time I get home I don't want to sit in front of a computer again. So that's left hobby, and I havehad a whole other blog for that… although I've been concentrating on the practical side of the hobby for once, so haven't been writing much there either.

So in short, we're in one of my regular "blogging takes a backseat" phases. You should be used to them by now! I do still feel "the pull" to write, and regularly feel like I should be writing here more (as opposed to [venting on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MstrKapowski)), it's just not happening for a variety of reasons.

C'est la vie.

To paraphrase Good Ol' JR: "business will eventually pick up."
