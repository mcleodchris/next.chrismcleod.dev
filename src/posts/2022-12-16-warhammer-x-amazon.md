With the news that Amazon Studios, in partnership with Henry Cavill and Vertigo Pictures, are [buying the film and TV rights to the Warhammer 40,000 IP](https://www.warhammer-community.com/2022/12/16/warhammer-starring-henry-cavill/), I have a couple of initial thoughts:

- I **can't wait** for a whole new audience to miss the point that the fascists are not the good guys, in much the same way as _Judge Dredd_, _The Boys_, _Starship Troopers_, _Robocop_, and many others…
- I really hope they focus on telling stories _in_ the Warhammer 40,000 setting, and not the story _of_ the Warhammer 40,000 setting. A larger-scale, bigger budget _Hammer & Bolter_ or _Interrogator_ would probably work quite well, in my opinion… Possibly even something like **Angels of Death**, although I'm not convinced Space Marine stories will work well without 1) watering down many aspects of what makes them interesting, 2) spending a lot of money to get the look right.

With those worries stated, Cavill is a massive fan, and takes sticking to the heart of source material seriously - as seen in his disputes with the direction of _The Witcher_, so if anyone can help steer the ship correctly, he's probably one of the best picks out there.
