All going well - and DNS willing - this site has been migrated off of Wordpress.com and back to self-hosted. That's all well and good, but along the way, the site has picked up a couple of new tricks -

- IndieWeb integration through microformats and Webmention
- Fediverse integration through ActivityPub

Fediverse support means you can now (for example) follow this blog on Mastodon, by followingÂ **@chris@chrismcleod.dev**. You might even be able to like and comment directly from Mastodon (I haven't tested this Update: commenting via a reply works). Regular RSS options are still available.

[IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) features come by way of the plugins provided by the community, and the [Autonomie](https://github.com/pfefferle/Autonomie) theme by [Matthias Pfefferle](https://notiz.blog/) (who also wrote the ActivityPub plugin I'm using). I haven't rolled out all of the possible features - I'm not using Post Kinds yet, for example - as I want to think a bit more about what I want to achieve with the site before I go overboard.

Moving everything over was relatively quick and painless, and the setup of new features was simple. There's a couple of small things to tidy up, and more to be added to the site as time goes on. I'll write up the process of getting things setup in another post so others can replicate on their own site if they want.
