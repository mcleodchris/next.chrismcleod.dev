A few summary thoughts, now I've managed to play Red Dead Redemption 2 for a few hours

- The visuals are stunning, in a grim and gritty, "totally the opposite of Odyssey" kind of way.
- The story is compelling, so far, and as it's mostly told through brief interactions with other characters, leaves me wanting more.
- It very much feels like a "slow burn" kind of game. Nothing yet has happened at any sort of pace. For the most part, this is _great_. But it gets annoying when other characters are trying to hurry you along but Arthur Morgan moves and performs actions with the speed of a tranquillised slothâ€¦
- The controls are very different to every other game I've played this year, so I find myself pressing the wrong button _constantly._
- Some mechanics in the game seem unnecessarily finicky and/or just plain unnecessary.
- The skinning animation is unnecessarily gratuitous.
