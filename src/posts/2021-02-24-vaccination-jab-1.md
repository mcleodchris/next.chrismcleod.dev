I’ve had my first COVID vaccination jab! I was given the AstraZeneca version. It felt a little odd to be out on public transport for the first time in a while. The centre is in a new development I’ve never been to before, so I missed the stop I should have got off at, but thankfully the bus driver let me off before he got too much further along his route.
