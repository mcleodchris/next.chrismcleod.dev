An automated copyright filter wrongly had Google de-index a blog post written by an EU parlimentarian, which warned against the use of automated copyright filters and the impending Article 13 copyright directive.

> Specifically -- and it would be hard to make this up if we tried -- Topple Track's automated filter got Google to de-index [this blog post by Reda](https://juliareda.eu/2018/05/censorship-machines-link-tax-finish-line/), in which she details the problems in Article 13 and how it will create mandatory censorship machines, that would likely lead to massive internet censorship of perfectly legitimate content.
