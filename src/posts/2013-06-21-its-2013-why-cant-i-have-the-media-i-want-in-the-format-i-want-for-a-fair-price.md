Tonight I was hoping to watch _Dredd_, and _The Amazing Spider-Man_, as I've got a free Friday night, and for some reason, none of my other choices appealed to me... Explaining more would be a tangent, so lets continue with the story.

I was at the supermarket, and both films were on offer (DVD versions). I thought about picking them up, but thought "no, I'll only watch them once, so having the DVD is needless clutter." I figured I'd look on Netflix, or as a fall-back, rent on iTunes.

Neither film is available on Netflix, which sucks a bit, but never mind, let's check iTunes... Neither film is available to rent[^1], so I'd have to buy... But the cost of _Dredd_ is twice what the DVD would've cost, and _The Amazing Spider-Man_ is almost an amazing _three times_ the price! That to me seems like a bit of a rip-off.

So if I want to watch those movies at a wallet-friendly price I need to either a) go back to the store and buy 2 discs I don't want, or b) pirate them. Neither option is appealing, so I'm unlikely to be watching these films like I'd hoped to.

It's 2013, and we're heading to a world where physical media is on its way out. So why is digital still so bleedin' frustrating?

[^1]: as an aside, finding films to rent through the iPad version of the iTunes Store really, really, sucks!
