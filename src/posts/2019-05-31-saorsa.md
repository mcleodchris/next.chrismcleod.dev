I've started using my new(ish) [test site](https://mrkapowski.dev/) to build my new IndieWeb WordPress theme. It's very early in the process, and I'm getting the markup in place first, before I go anywhere near a stylesheet - so it all looks very 1996 right now.

The [lessons learned on "K"](https://mrkapowski.com/tag/k-theme) will be put into use with this theme, along with several ideas I've picked up along the way. I've already reused some of the more useful bits of K to give me a head-start, so I know that stuff like the feed and post microformats should be pretty robust (if not yet 100% complete). The main improvement I want to make over K is in flexibilityÂ  - i.e. it's not just usable by me, or locks me/the user into a particular setup.

If there is anything you would like to see in an IndieWeb WordPress theme, or any other suggestions, please [file an issue in the repository](https://github.com/MrKapowski/Saorsa/issues). I can't promise I'll implement it, but at this stage, the chances are high ðŸ˜‰
