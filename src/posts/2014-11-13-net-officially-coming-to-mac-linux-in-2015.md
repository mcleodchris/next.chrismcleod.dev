Straight from the blog of [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/AnnouncingNET2015NETAsOpenSourceNETOnMacAndLinuxAndVisualStudioCommunity.aspx):

> - **We are serious about open source and cross platform.**
>   - .NET Core 5 is the modern, componentized framework that ships via NuGet. That means you can ship a private version of the .NET Core Framework with your app. Other apps' versions can't change your app's behavior.
>   - We are building a .NET Core CLR for Windows, Mac and Linux and it will be both open source and it will be supported by Microsoft. It'll all happen at [https://github.com/dotnet](http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://github.com/dotnet).
>   - We are open sourcing the RyuJit and the .NET GC and making them both cross-platform.
> - **ASP.NET 5 will work everywhere.**
>   - ASP.NET 5 will be available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Mac and Linux support will come soon and it's all going to happen in the open on GitHub at [https://github.com/aspnet](http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://github.com/aspnet).
>   - ASP.NET 5 will include a web server for Mac and Linux called kestrel built on libuv. It's similar to the one that comes with node, and you could front it with Nginx for production, for example.
> - **Developers should have a great experience.**
>   - There is a new FREE SKU for Visual Studio for open source developers and students called[**Visual Studio Community**](http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=518338)**.** It supports extensions and lots more all in one download. This is not Express. This is basically Pro.

There's more over on [his blog post](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/AnnouncingNET2015NETAsOpenSourceNETOnMacAndLinuxAndVisualStudioCommunity.aspx), but as a developer, I think this is a very big deal. My first words, when I read about it were pretty much _"holy shit."_
