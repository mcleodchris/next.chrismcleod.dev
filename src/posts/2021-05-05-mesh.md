I finally decided it was time to upgrade my trusty TP-Link WiFi-N router to something a bit more modern. Even though it's an older router, it's been far more reliable and stable than just about any ISP-supplied router I've had the misfortune to use.

I finished setting up the fancy new "mesh" system in about 15 minutes. It was much easier than previous home networking gear I've used! Plug one node in, let the Linksys app do the work, then enter my ISP username and password. Once the first node is fully up and running, plug in the other nodes one by one and let the app do the rest. All the iOS devices "just worked" with the new network, apart from the HomePods - which needed to be "moved" using the Home app. Other than that: 2 LifX bulbs needed to be reset and readded, while the games consoles and Windows PCs needed the new password input (even though it was the same as on the old router).

WiFi connections seem to be rock solid throughout the house now, and browsing a few sites and services "feels" a bit snappier, but that could just be confirmation bias. There's a parent node in the hallway, then child nodes in the busy areas - the living room and office - which ensure the whole house is well covered.

After installing a firmware update, the nodes all integrate with HomeKit, which is a nice to have. This lets me restrict HomeKit-compatible devices to only my local network, for security purposes. It's not essential, but if it's there, why not use it?

I guess the real test will come tomorrow when we're both working and making Teams voice and video calls all day.
