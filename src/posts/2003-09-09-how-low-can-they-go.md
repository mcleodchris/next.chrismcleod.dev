[The RIAA is sueing a 12 year old girl, for "massive copyright infringements through file-swapping".](https://web.archive.org/web/20040921212914/http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/32731.html "RIAA suing 12 year old girl") Under legislation, this could mean her paying "damages" of upto $150,000Â *per song*.

Just when you thought they could go now lower, they pull this one... I hope they get seriously nailed to the wall for it. Surely it can't be long now before they get investigated by the feds, for what they're doing?

Either that, or people should wake up and [Boycott the RIAA](https://web.archive.org/web/20040921212914/http://www.boycottriaa.com/ "Boycott the RIAA").
