I'm not gonna lie -Â Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) looks pretty nice.

I'm currently out of contract on my iPhone. I'll see what like the new iPhone is like, plus whatever Google Nexus phone running Jelly Bean comes out next, and make up my mind which to get.

I've already done iPhone > Android > iPhone, so if the Nexus is compelling I have no problem switching back. Just so long as it's not some super-sized Hulk of a phone.
