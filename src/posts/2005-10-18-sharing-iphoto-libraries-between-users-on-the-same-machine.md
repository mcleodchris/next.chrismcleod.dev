Does anyone know of a simple, _clean_ method for sharing a iPhoto library between two users on the same machine? One that doesn’t require a heap of aliases/running applescripts to change permissions everytime iPhoto is run? It seems such a basic requirement, I’m shocked that there isn’t a way to do it already in iPhoto…
