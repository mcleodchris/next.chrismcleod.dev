[This toot](https://mastodon.social/@davew/109648648337976715) by [Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/) reminded me I meant to write down how I’m trying to make sure I write more on this blog in 2023, even if it might be more trivial than what I’ve historically written here in the past.

Essentially: if I catch myself writing a post somewhere else, and I’m approaching the character limit, putting in line breaks/formatting, or otherwise notice that with a bit of light editing it could be a short blog post, then I copy the text over to here and make it fit. I want the order of priority of where I post to to be:

- Here, first and foremost, for anything that has even a modicum of thought put into it.
- [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@chrisplusplus), for anything that’s totally throwaway
- [My new micro blog](https://micro.chrismcleod.dev) for anything that fits anywhere between either those two (mostly I’m going to use it for tracking my reading progress, but it might get the odd link post or stray thought too )

Thanks to fediverse integration in all of the places I write, plus support for multiple feed formats, getting my words “out there” isn’t something I need to worry about, so I’m just going to try to concentrate on writing instead.
