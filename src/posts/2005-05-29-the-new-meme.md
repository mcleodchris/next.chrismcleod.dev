[John](https://web.archive.org/web/20060422031025/http://www.joshuaink.com/) has just passed me the new _meme_ that’s doing the rounds. This one’s something to do with a literary stick. Is that a book club? (ok, ok, that was a _really bad joke_!)

Well, as it’s Sunday and I haven’t had any more [elasticy](/blog/about-elastic-layouts/) thoughts this weekend, I suppose we better get started!

## 5 Random Tunes (iTunes Party Shuffle)

1. _Laura_ – Scissor Sistors
2. _Teethgrinder_ – Therapy?
3. _Stories_ – Therapy?
4. _Stand Inside Your Love_ – Smashing Pumpkins
5. _Steve Berman_ – Eminem

## Currently Reading

I haven’t got anything lined up at the moment.

## Ok, Last Book you Read?

Star Wars, Episode III: Revenge of the Sith

## Last film I saw

Star Wars, Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (noticing a connection?)

## The Next Victims

Next to be beaten by the stick will be:
