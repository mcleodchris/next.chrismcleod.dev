[The Outline: Let's all go back to Tumblr](https://theoutline.com/post/5811/why-tumblr-is-better-than-twitter-and-we-should-bring-it-back). I get the sentiment, but Tumblr isn't the place it used to be, since at least when it was acquired the first time around. I might be biased, but maybe independent sites and blogs connected through links and RSS syndication might be a better long-term solution?
