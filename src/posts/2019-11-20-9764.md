I'm giving [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/) a quick go, based in part on [Chris's experiences](https://boffosocko.com/2018/12/03/using-inoreader-as-an-indieweb-feed-reader/) using it as a [Social Reader](https://indieweb.org/reader). The idea of hooking into IFTTT to create various posts on this blog based on what I read appeals to me. Inoreader allows subscribing to OPML feeds instead of importing a static file - allowing for dynamically managing my subscriptions. Chris [manages this through his Following page](https://boffosocko.com/2017/11/10/a-following-page/), and I'm planning to do something similar with my [Links](https://mrkapowski.com/links) page, although to get this working I'm going to have to go back through my list and add any RSS feed URLs to the entry.

I should take the time to get all my "followings" back in sync during the exercise. I dropped Feedly last year, and I've never quite finished porting everything I had there to [Aperture](https://aperture.p3k.io)[/](https://monocle.p3k.io)[Monocle](https://monocle.p3k.io), or to the Links page. I've not synced everything I've added to Aperture back to the Links page either. So much housekeeping to catch up on.
