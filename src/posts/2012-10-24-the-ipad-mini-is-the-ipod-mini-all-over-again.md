Things said about the iPod Mini:

- Competitors are cheaper
- Competitors have more features
- Competitors are smaller
- It's not "open"
- It'll never sell (or, my favourite: "the only people who'll buy it are Apple 'Sheeple/fanboi's/posers' with too much money")
- You're paying an "Apple Tax" just because it looks pretty/has an Apple logo

Things said about the iPad Mini in the 24 hours since it was announced:

- Competitors are cheaper
- Competitors have more features
- Competitors are smaller
- It's not "open"
- It'll never sell (or, my favourite: "the only people who'll buy it are Apple 'Sheeple/fanboi's/posers' with too much money")
- You're paying an "Apple Tax" just because it looks pretty/has an Apple logo

Even though I doubt I'll be buying one in the short-term, make no mistake - I think the iPad Mini will sell in droves, just like the iPod Mini went on to.

I confidently believe it will outsell the Google Nexus 7, and probably also the Kindle Fire (the biggest competition in my mind) this Christmas, despite the much higher price. Apple has shown consumers will pay that extra "tax" for the overall experience. Not only that, Joe/Jane Consumer can now see _the_ *name brand* iPad on sale below £300 for the first time. That's a really big deal for anyone not trapped in the Tech Bubble.
