I had my first practice run of my promotion presentation with a work colleague today, and it was nothing short of a disaster.

I arrived to the meeting already flustered. The current sprint is hard going, things have been going wrong, and I had been fire-fighting all morning. I also hadn't had any opportunity to practice my slides on my own. I had a rough idea of what I wanted to say, but no idea of the timings or anything.

Several times I lost my train of thought, had to stop, then restart the presentation. When I did finally manage to get off of the first slide, I'd talked for _over half_ of my allotted 15 minutes. In the end I felt like I was wasting my colleague's time, so I apologised for being so ill prepared and ended the session early so as to not waste any more. I was embarrassed, annoyed at myself, and even more flustered than when I started. Thankfully my colleague offered to "reschedule" our session to a later date, when hopefully I'll be in a better mindset.

Must do better.
