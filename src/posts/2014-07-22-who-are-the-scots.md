A wonderful piece byÂ Peter Arnott - [100 Days: Who Are The Scots?](http://peterarnott.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/who-are-scots.html)

> "But what guarantee is there that any of that would be better with independence?" is the question No voters ask.
>
> And Yes voters should answer: "WE are the guarantee. YOU are the guarantee. If, WE, the Scottish electorate elected then re-elected a government that did this to our people, then hell mend us. But do you really think we would do that? The point is not WHAT we would choose, but the fact that WE would have the choice. And if it we found that a government wasn't to our choice any more, we could vote against the cruelty and incompetence and hatred were doing all this to us...and, unlike now, it would make a difference. It would matter what we did and what we chose. The government would actually change. Right now, we can't do anything except complain about it in the pub. We want to make sure that our opinions count. We want to make sure that YOUR opinions count. Come with us!"
