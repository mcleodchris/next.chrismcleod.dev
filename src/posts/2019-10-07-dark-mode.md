“Dark mode” for this site has been one of those things on my todo list for a while. The in-development theme I’m working on has been built from the ground up to support it through the use of media queries and CSS custom properties — but I hadn’t actually implemented it. After a nudge from reading [this post](https://adactio.com/journal/15941) by [Jeremy](https://adactio.com/) I’ve finally implemented something to try out:

For now I’m borrowing Jeremy’s colours, but I’m planning to tweak these as the design evolves.
