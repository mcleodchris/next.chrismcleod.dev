I'm studying for the MS-900 exam (yes, yes, I know [I said I was going to take a break from exams](/2021/07/29/microsoft-certified-security-compliance-and-identity-fundamentals/)â€¦), and one thing I'm really struggling to reconcile in my head is that all of the security-related questions are **much** more technically in-depth than any of the questions I remember getting in the security-focussed SC-900 exam or its preparation material. In fact, a lot of the questions seem to be more in-depth than the equivilent tests for most of the other Fundamentals-level exams I've studied for.

Like, SC-900 didn't touch on Password Hash Sychronisation, or Pass-Through Authentication at all (at least, not by name). Like all 900-series exams it covered the area broadly, but at a relatively shallow technical knowledge level.

It's not a big thing, but it's enough of a WTF moment whenever it comes up that I often doubt myself when answering the practice questions, because _I should know this_. So far I'm finding MS-900 to be one of the harder Fundamentals exams to prepare for. Not quite as bad as PL-900, but it's getting up there. I've generally found the practice exams to be harder than the real thing (to help you learn the material), so it could be an element of that at play.

I guess we'll find out on Monday morning!
