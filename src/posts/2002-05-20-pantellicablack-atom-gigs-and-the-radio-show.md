I'm in quite a good mood today (0_0) despite having to get up horrendously early (well, 8:30am) to get to work...

Gawd, from next week, I've got to do it every week day for the rest of my working life. Oh dear.

Anyway... Yeah, my weekend was rather spiffy.

First up was a gig at Lava - Black Atom, supporting Pantellica who are a Pantera/Metallica tribute band from London. Atom were ace. They got a fantastic reception, had a brilliant sound, and were generally very ace. Pantellica... hmmm. The musicianship was all there. Shame the singer wasn't that great a metal singer. He wasn't a bad singer by any means, he just didn't suit metal. Especially not Metallica or Pantera. But ach well, it was fun anyway. Couldn't help but feel a little peeved that a tribute band get to play for 1 1/2 hours, while decent "proper" bands get 45 minutes or so, and the local bands get even less time.

Saturday was a blast. It was another gig, this time at Dr Drakes, featuring Hot Mangu & Black Atom (again). Also making some noise, was yours truely, making my DJ debut (well, if you don't count the AUBL radio show...). There was also the Elizium goth night afterwards. Despite a little confusion between me and the Elizium guys as to who was playing when, everything went pretty smoothly. I had great fun. Played a bit of everything, from Metallica/Iron Maiden etc, to A/Green Day etc. Played a few local things too - Quik, Sirius, Contra and We Become Less.

Sunday night was the radio show (AUBL on MeFM - 105.8fm 8 till 10 Sundays, 7-9 Wednesdays. Plug plug). We had Contra live in session, which was great, cos Contra are ace. Unfortunately, we didn't have a sound engineer for this show, so I ended up doing most of the "production", trying to get the levels right and stuff. It was all an ace laugh anyway, and the show went pretty well really. Only 3 more shows left I think... oh well, it's been fun.

Anyway, suppose I'd better go and get some work done...
