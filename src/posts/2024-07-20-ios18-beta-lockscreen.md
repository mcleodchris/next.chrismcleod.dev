    alt: The image shows a iPhone home screen with a plain black background. It features a large digital clock in the center, weather icons, and a padlock icon indicating smart home connectivity. The top of the screen displays signal, Wi-Fi, and battery icons, while the bottom has a prompt to swipe up to open. The icons and widgets have been tinted so they are in greyscale/black and white.

The wallpaper is line art of a locked padlock in light grey centred on the screen, on a black background, as if to indicate the device is locked. The top of the screen displays signal, Wi-Fi, and battery icons, while the bottom has a prompt to swipe up to open.
