My GeForce 4 Ti 4800 also arrived today. Unreal Tournament never looked so good! 1280\*1024, with all detail levels set to highest... and it never once dropped below 38fps during an intense 12 bot deathmatch.

On the down-side, adding it to my case has pushed the average ambient temperature up 3-5 degrees, to about 35 degrees celcius...
