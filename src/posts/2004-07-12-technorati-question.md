Ever since I joined [Technorati](https://web.archive.org/web/20040726182032/http://www.technorati.com/) and "claimed ownership" of this blog (andÂ [Gentooist](https://web.archive.org/web/20040726182032/http://www.gentooist.co.uk/)), my [Technorati Profile](https://web.archive.org/web/20040726182032/http://www.technorati.com/profile/chrismcleod) has always read "No Verified Blogs". What exactly do I have to do to change this? I _thought_ the instructions were something along the line of:

1. Signup to Technorati
2. Add a Blog
3. Embed Technorati profile link in pages
4. Setup MovableType to ping Technorati when posting an entry
5. Write

Am I missing a magical step? I've done all that, written several entries since joining and yet there's been no change. The mind boggles!

Hopefully a more enlightened user will hear my call and be able to shed some light..?
