In any normal job, if an employee -- who was [on his final warning](http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-31815727) due to disciplinary issues -- punched his boss, he would be sacked on the spot, and very likely arrested. Everyone would think that was fair and normal outcome. If you're Jeremy Clarkson, however, you get a suspension and [thousands signing a petition](http://www.nme.com/filmandtv/news/over-200-000-sign-online-petition-to-reinstate-sus/371883) calling for your reinstatement because according to those I've seen on social media, it's a "political correctness gone too far" issue.

No. Just no.
