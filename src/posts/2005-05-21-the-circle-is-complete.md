Last night I finally went to see _Star Wars, Episode III: Revenge of the Sith_. The place was packed, but I managed to grab one of the few remaining seats with a decent view. It was also hot – the guy in the Wookie costume, 3 rows back must’ve been sweating his arse off. Despite the warnings that Episode 3 wasn’t suitable for younger viewers, there were a lot of young kids in the audience.

I won’t spoil the film for those that haven’t seen it yet, and I don’t really want to “review” it, as such. Maybe later.

Leaving the cinema was kinda strange. Everyone seemed kinda muted. Normally the line coming out’ve a film is loud, full of people gossiping about what they just watched. But there were only handful of people that were chatting and even they seemed aware that most people were quiet. It was one of the wierdest experiences I’ve had at the cinema.

I honestly don’t know how ROTS has left me feeling. I can’t honestly say whether I thought it was good or bad. Perhaps I need to see it again. Maybe watching the original trilogy _before_ going to see it spoiled it. Reading the book might have thrown my hopes and expectations off. I just don’t know.

But the important thing is that the saga has been completed. The missing piece is in place. There’s _closure_.

At least until the DVD comes out!
