[Paying tribute to the web with View Source](https://m.signalvnoise.com/paying-tribute-to-the-web-with-view-source/).

I love View Source. I still use it daily. I'm not a person who builds sites in JavaScript - that's never really been my thing. I love to craft in HTML. I get annoyed when I can't alter or overwrite the output HTML of a WordPress function or plugin, and have been known to reimplement it myself if necessary.

Right now, K is a lot messier under the hood than I'd like. Once things are a bit more defined I intend to go back and clean it up so the output source is as readable as possible (proper and consistent indenting and the like), and the structure is better from a POSH point of view.
