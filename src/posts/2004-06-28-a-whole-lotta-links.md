Just came by [this massive list of great web standards articles](https://web.archive.org/web/20040802235511/http://www.orderedlist.com/articles/simple_list "OrderedList.com : Simple List") by way of[Simplebits](https://web.archive.org/web/20040802235511/http://www.simplebits.com/) (where you can also find this list).

I think, out've the 450+ links, I've read around about 30 or 40 of them... Time to get reading!

For posterity, I've duplicated the full list below.
