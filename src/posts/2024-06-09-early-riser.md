I was planning to write a blog post about getting up early in the near future, but [Johnny Decimal went and beat me to it](https://johnnydecimal.com/22.00.0058/), so that spurred me to write it sooner.

For the last four months or so we've made a point of waking up at 5am. Prior to that I'd found myself getting up later and later. Some days I was essentially going straight from bed to desk (by way of the shower), having breakfast as I read through morning emails. It wasn't good or sustainable. The drift started during the lockdown phase of the pandemic; initially I'd kept to my 6:10am "going to the office" routine, but eventually it started to give way to the stress of the situation. 5 minutes here, 20 there… before I knew it I effectively had no alarm or routine.

I can't remember what spurred the idea to enforce this new 5am alarm. We did it for a week last year, as my partner wanted to film [a video for her YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEwS1T6xtmo), but it didn't become a habit. I think I remembered us both feeling good about it at the time and thought it might be an antidote to how rubbish I was feeling about my current lack of routine. I once joked with my partner that my 2 underlying motivators are smugness and spite - and getting up early feels like it falls into the former.

So here we are, after the dust has had a chance to settle. How has it been? Honestly, _pretty good_. Some mornings are a struggle still, and a couple of times I've slapped my alarm off at 5am, then looked at my watch a moment later and it's 6:30… but **getting out of bed at 5** is not a hard and fast rule (yet?). The goal is to have more time before work, and I'm still achieving that.

So what do I do with this "extra" time? Mostly it's a mental health "firebreak"; dedicated time before work to de-stress and otherwise get into a good place mentally. Unlike Johnny, I _don't_ start work any earlier. I've done the "start hours before the rest of the team thing so I can get work done" thing in the past, and it worked wonderfully when I was in an office, but I found it hasn't worked so well when working from home. Your mileage may vary, of course. If I do want to do anything productive, I catch up on things like laundry, dishes, or other household tasks I've invariably been putting off. Lately I've even taken to playing 45-60 minutes of [World of Warcraft (Pandaria Remix)](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24092672/updated-225-world-of-warcraft-remix-mists-of-pandaria-now-live) before work. Not so much a "productive" thing but it's meant I'm starting the work day in a good mood. [Dragon Riding around Jade Forest](https://youtu.be/72NuXapPDn0) is such a great way to unwind.
