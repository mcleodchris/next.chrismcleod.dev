[Second Home is a newly-opened caf√© + studio in Aberdeen](https://www.secondhomeaberdeen.com/). My partner visited while [I was in London](https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/soaring/), and was raving about the brownie she'd had ever since, so we decided to make a date of it and go for brunch at the weekend. The food and drink were great, and the atmosphere was very relaxed and spacious. I can see us becoming semi-regular visitors!
