[Games Revisited on Q\*Bert](https://gamesrevisited.com/2018/08/27/qbert-gottlieb-1982-arcade/):

> There isn’t much to say… **Q\*bert** is a simple puzzle game that loops forever until you get bored or die.
>
> The reason why **Q\*bert** isn’t as fondly remembered as Space Invaders or Pac-Man is because it is nowhere near as good both those games were fast paced and fun. Yes they get repetitive, and limited but they are fun in doses. **Q\*bert** can fuck off back in to the sea and suck his cock nose. The bastard.
