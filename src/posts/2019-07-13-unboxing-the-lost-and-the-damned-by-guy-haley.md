It features a sepia toned illustration of the angel-winged Primarch, Sanguinius, standing sentinel behind a trench of conscripted Imperial soldiers.

_The Lost and the Damned_ is the follow up to _[The Solar War](/blog/unboxing-the-solar-war-by-john-french/)_, and second book in the eight-part _The Siege of Terra_ series. The collector’s Edition is every bit as gorgeous as the first book. I can’t wait to get stuck in!
