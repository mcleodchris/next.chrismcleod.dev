This afternoon I passed the [Microsoft PL-900 exam](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/certifications/exams/pl-900), earning my second certification this year - [Microsoft Certified: Power Platform Fundamentals](https://www.credly.com/earner/earned/badge/687bac44-4af0-4519-849b-3f869c68db2a).

Let me be upfront by saying: I really did not enjoy this certification. For whatever reason, I just could not connect with the subject matter, and the last few weeks have felt like an uphill struggle the whole way through. Even when I tried getting hands-on with the various pieces of the Power Platform, a lot of it was just plain unenjoyable. Power Automate and Power Virtual Agents seem interesting enough, but Power BI and Power Apps are areas I'd be happy to not have to be around again.

Maybe it was because I didn't know much about Power Platform before starting (other than a nugget of Power BI exposure in my [Azure Data Fundamentals certification](https://chrismcleod.dev/2021/06/01/microsoft-certified-azure-data-fundamentals/)), but I really did not expect so much of the course and exam to be taken up by Microsoft Dynamics. At times it felt like a big disadvantage to not have prior knowledge and experience of Dymanics and [Dataverse](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/introduction-common-data-service/).

Still, sometimes you just have to power through (pardon the pun). To pass the exam I used [Microsoft Learn's free online resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/certifications/power-platform-fundamentals/), and both the [Whizlabs video course and practice tests](https://www.whizlabs.com/microsoft-power-platform-fundamentals-pl-900/). I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have passed if I hadn't made such heavy use of those practice tests. In the end, they were the only thing it felt was making the topic "stick".

With PL-900 out of the way, I just have one more exam to do from my [Summer of Certifications](https://chrismcleod.dev/2021/05/21/summer-of-certifications/) list. AI-900 is up next, and it's probably the certifiation I'm most looking forward to.
