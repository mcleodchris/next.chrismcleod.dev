As I'm writing this, I'm 36,000 feet over Canadian airspace, on my way to San Francisco (you may have guessed this already, from the title). By the time you're reading this, I should be safely on the ground again (no in-flight wifi to let me post from the air. It's a little bit of a impromptu visit; I certainly hadn't dreamed I'd be making this trip, even as recently as a couple of months ago. But that's by-the-by at this point - there's no turning back now!

This will be only my second trip to the United States - my first being Houston in 2011 - so I'll be very interested to see the (no doubt many) differences. It's only a short trip too, as I fly back to the UK on Wednesday, so I'll need to try cram a lot in to make the most of it!

I have one particular bit of business to do while I'm in town[^1], but the rest of the time is mine, and to be honest, it's a very welcome break. Things have been so hectic and stressful over the last few months (and not entirely in a good way) that I'm in desperate need of some "R&R". Hopefully this trip will provide some of that!

As this trip might be a once in a lifetime thing, I've packed my full set of camera equipment, so hopefully I can get some memorable photos while I'm here. If I can manage, I'll try post them up while at the end of each day.

Now, if only I wasn't missing the live broadcast of The Day of The Doctor, this trip might've been even more _perfect_. Guess what my first priority is, when I land?
