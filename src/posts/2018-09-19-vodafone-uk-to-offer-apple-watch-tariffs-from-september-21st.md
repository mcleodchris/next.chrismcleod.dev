If, like me, you tried to activate your LTE-enabled Apple Watch Series 3 on Vodafone UK, immediately after upgrading to WatchOS 5, you'll have been met with a bunch of errors. It turns out that Friday 21st September is the day that everything gets switched on at the Vodafone end to allow you to sign up. No word yet on pricing.
