I ordered _Powers of Darkness_ for Caley’s birthday. It’s an “alternative” version of Dracula. The story behind it sounds like it could be worthy of a novel in and of itself:

> In 1901 Icelandic publisher and writer Vladimar Ásmundsson set out to translate Bram Stoker’s classic novel, _Dracula_. Called _Makt Myrkranna_, the Icelandic version was unnoticed outside the country until 1986, when _Dracula_ scholars discovered Stoker’s original preface to the book. It was not until 2014, however, that noted _Dracula_ scholar Hans Corneel de Roos realised that Ásmundsson hadn’t merely translated _Dracula_ but had, rather, penned an entirely new version of the story, with some all-new characters and a re-worked plot. The resulting narrative is one that is shorter, punchier, more erotic, and rivals the original in terms of suspense.
