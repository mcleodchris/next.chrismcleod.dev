I got my first COVID vaccination jab a couple of days ago, so for the benefit of others I thought I'd share my experience.

First off, for the first 24 hours (almost exactly) after the jab, I had zero side effects. From that 24 hour mark I gradually started to feel a bit worse -

- slight sore/scratchy throat
- chills
- body aches

In all, it was like I had a bad cold, but without a runny nose. I went to bed slightly early last night, feeling a little rough and expecting to feel rubbish this morning.

As it turned out, I woke up feeling absolutely fine. It's as if yesterday afternoon/evening didn't happen at all.

Having spoken to my project manager, who received his vaccination a few hours earlier than I did, his experience was almost exactly the same - right down to the 24 hour gap between first dose and experiencing any side effects.

All-in-all, it was much more pleasant than I'd expected; certainly, I've had much worse experiences with the yearly flu vaccination!
