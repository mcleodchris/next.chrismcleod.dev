Space Hulk is one of my all-time favourite games. It's one of the best rule sets ever written by Games Workshop. It's been out of print for a few years now, but it looks like it's being brought back for a limited-run re-release.

Rumours have been swirling for a few days now, and this morning Games Workshop put up a teaser video on [their White Dwarf Daily blog](http://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/What's-New-Today-from-the-White-Dwarf-Team/2014/09/03/Destroy-or-Devour).

It's the standard, ropey, low-budget GW affair, simply panning across a piece of artwork depicting a Space Marine being fitted into Terminator armour. But at roughly 31 seconds in, for a few fractions of a second, another picture flashes up, showing a Terminator fighting a Genestealer - the classic badguys in Space Hulk.

So it looks like Space Hulk is on its way back. While I'm very happy, my wallet is off crying in the corner!

Thanks to [Matt on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thefirstautarch) for sending me this other still from ~14 seconds in, which I initially missed:
