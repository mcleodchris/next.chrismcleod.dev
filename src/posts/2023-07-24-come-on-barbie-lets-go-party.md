I recently had the pleasure of visiting the cinema to watch the highly anticipated movie, Barbie, and I must say, it was an absolute blast! Going in, I had mixed expectations - basically expecting something similar to The Lego Movie (funny, a few touching moments, but ultimately empty), but what I got was so much more.

From the very start, I was hooked. I was pretty much smiling or laughing the whole way through. It weaved heartwarming moments throughout, making it a well-rounded and engaging experience. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were undoubtedly the stars of the show, and they played their roles to perfection, adding an extra layer of charm to the movie.

Margot Robbie's portrayal of Barbie was exceptional, bringing the iconic character to life with a unique blend of humour, heart, and occasional obliviousness. Ryan Gosling's performance as Ken was nothing short of magnificent. I genuinely think I could watch an entire Ken movie based on his portrayal. Their chemistry on-screen was undeniable, and they truly seemed to be having a blast in their respective roles. Also - a shout-out to America Ferrera who adds the emotional core to the second half of the movie and who was brilliant in her role.

There have been some "murmurs" online about the film being "anti-men," but in my mind – this is complete nonsense, and most likely performative. Personally I found it very much "pro men", particularly in the final act of the movie, if you actually pay attention. The core message of Barbie is positive and empowering for everyone, regardless of gender. It celebrates the importance of embracing individuality, being true to oneself, and supporting each other. The film's underlying messages of inclusivity and empowerment are evident throughout, and these are not bad things.

As I left the cinema, I couldn't help but [reflect](https://bsky.app/profile/chrismcleod.dev/post/3k34gi4hce62r) on the amazing experience I had just had. Barbie far exceeded my expectations, and I wholeheartedly recommend everyone to go see it. Whether you're part of the target audience, or just looking for a fun-filled and heartwarming cinematic escape, Barbie has something for everyone. So if you can, I recommend you take time to go see it.
