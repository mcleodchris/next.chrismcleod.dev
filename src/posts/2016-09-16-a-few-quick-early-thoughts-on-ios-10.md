### Lock Screen

**Raise to Wake** is a feature I've wanted for a while, so I love that. It sometimes seems a little sensitive, but I guess I'll either get used to it, or it'll be tweaked in a software update. The new behaviour of unlocking your phone without going to the Home Screen until you press the Home button seemed a bit unintuitive to me, I've changed a setting under _General_ > _Accessibility_ > *Home Button* to remove the press.

### Notifications

Functionally, the new **notifications** are great, and will get better as more apps embrace the feature. [Like others](https://twitter.com/johnwards/status/776030913541070849), I'm not a fan of the styling, which is very evocative of "Web 2.0". **Clear All** is another minor feature I've wanted forever, so I'm glad that's there; I just wish I hadn't had to Google to discover it's hidden behind a 3D Touch gesture. These hidden or unintuitive features and gestures are probably my biggest peeve with iOS 10 for now.

Related to the notification area, I don't get why the "Today" widget area is duplicated here _and_ to the left of the Home Screen. One or the other would've been better, at least in my opinion. Maybe because I never used the old "Today" screen, but did use the old search screen which used to be to the left of the Home Screen…

### Messages

Overall I like the update, but I've found some of the new features to be really unintuitive to use. The **message styles** (hidden ink, balloons, etc) are hidden behind a 3D Touch of the send button - so if you don't get it right you'll find yourself accidentally sending the message before it's finished. This is a very minor thing, but it does cause frustration. I also found the **Digital Ink** features to be confusing to use, and the associated gestures a bit hit-and-miss. "Playback" of these messages is also hit-and-miss: sometimes they play automatically, but most times they don't.

[This article from The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/tldr/2016/9/14/12914758/imessage-ios-10-update-apps-stickers-effects-how-to) has a good rundown of the new features of iMessage and how they work.

### Other

Being able to (finally) **remove in-built** apps is obviously something which has received some headlines. Surprisingly, I've removed fewer than I expected… I think it's only Stocks, Tips, Find My Friends and weather. I've actually found myself _switching to_ a couple of the in-built apps
