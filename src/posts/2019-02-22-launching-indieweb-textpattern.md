_Editors Note: The links to #Indieweb Textpattern do not work. I am working to port that content over to this site. This page will be updated when that work is complete._

I [noted the other day](/blog/textpattern/) that [Textpattern](https://textpattern.com/) might be a good fit for some people trying to build their own websites, but that there wasn't much in the way of resources to get them [plugged into the IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/Getting_Started).

Well, I went and started to do something about that. [#IndieWeb TextPattern](https://txp.kpw.fyi/) is a site where I will be exploring and documenting how to add various IndieWeb building-blocks to their Textpattern website. There's not a whole lot of stuff there yet: just [the mission statement](https://txp.kpw.fyi/articles/welcome-to-indieweb-textpattern), and [how to add an h-card](https://txp.kpw.fyi/articles/step-1-add-your-h-card) using form templates; but my intent is for the site to grow into a kind of guidebook for interested parties to be pointed to from the IndieWeb wiki and elsewhere. I was inspired by the [short](https://quickthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com/2019/02/10/how-to-add-an-h-card-to-blogger-indieweb) [series](https://quickthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com/2019/02/10/how-to-add-webmentions-to-blogger) of posts [Gary](https://quickthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com/pages/home) put together about [Blogger](https://drmacsspot.blogspot.com/) recently.

It's been years since I last used Textpattern -- possibly more than a decade(!) -- so there will have to be a lot of experimenting and exploration before I figure out everything that will be needed. I want to get the "quick wins" out of the way at the start, then at some point I anticipate having to write new code as part of this projectâ€¦ hopefully just as Textpattern plugins, but there might be some features which need a "bridge" service to get working. I mention in [the introductory post](https://txp.kpw.fyi/articles/3/welcome-to-indieweb-textpattern) some of the areas where I think I'm going to have to write code, but for now, those are all later concerns ?

In the more immediate future, my planned content includes: getting a site ready for IndieAuth, adding microformats to post templates, _receiving_ WebMentions, and possibly implementing post kinds in a manual capacity. If you have any suggestions at all for the site or topics, please do let me know!
