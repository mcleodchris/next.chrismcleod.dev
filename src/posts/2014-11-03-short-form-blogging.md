Gina Trapini gives [a few ideas about short-form blogging](http://scribbling.net/2014/10/16/short-form-blogging/), for when Twitter is too short, and a full article is too long (such as on Medium). Her new "rules" are all things I've mulled over. In particular, this item from her list is one resonates with me a lot:

> **Negotiate a comfort zone** on two axes: personal and public, tech and everything else (feminism, musical theater, MMA, parenting, etc). 2001-era Scribbling.net was too personal, Lifehacker/Smarterware too tech. There’s something in the middle.

This blog tends to go quieter when I'm struggling to balance writing between personal and public, or when the immediacy of [Twitter](http://twitter.com/MstrKapowski "Chris McLeod on Twitter") overwhelms the need to _say_ something. The number of times I've bent over backwards to get a thought into 140 characters is ridiculous. Not everything belongs on the blog, but probably more does than I've been writing.
