One of the gifts I bought Girl Wonder for Christmas was the [Nintendo NES Classic Mini](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Misc-/Nintendo-Classic-Mini-Nintendo-Entertainment-System/Nintendo-Classic-Mini-Nintendo-Entertainment-System-1124287.html). I managed to get in the 2nd preorder batch from the official Nintendo UK site, and it arrived *just* in time to be put under the tree. I'll have some more thoughts on the NES Mini itself, later. Anyway, I set it up last night so she could have her first play-through of some of the games (Super Mario 3 is her favourite game of all-time). It's safe to say it was a hit. I went to bed just after 10pm after being told "I'm just having one more go \[at Dr. Mario\]." At 00:30am she finally came to bed.
