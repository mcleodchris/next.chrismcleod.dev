Now that I'd completed the [data](https://chrismcleod.dev/2021/06/01/microsoft-certified-azure-data-fundamentals/) [side](https://chrismcleod.dev/2021/06/13/microsoft-certified-power-platform-fundamentals/) of Azure, I wanted to try out something I was a little less familiar with; I've not gone near anything Machine Learning or AI-related in my work so far, so I felt getting at least some exposure to these topics wouldn't go amiss. I'm glad I opted to add [Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Fundamentals \[AI-900\]](https://www.credly.com/badges/a4dd4daa-9cb8-4706-bbba-924de3e8eff4/public_url) into the mix of what I'm studying this summer. It was a fun course, and one I fully recommend.

I wasn't expecting to enjoy this topic as much as I did. Maybe it was partly a reaction to how little I'd enjoyed the Power Platform Fundamentals course. AI/ML is not an area I see myself working on often, possibly never outside of certification courses, but I don't think I'd mind at all if someone did ask me to jump into a small project using Azure's AI platform and tools.

A lot of the exam focused on the [Responsible AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/ai/responsible-ai) priciples, along with identifying the different types of workloads, tools, and models to use. This was one of the easier exams I'd sat lately. It took me around twenty minutes to complete, and I passed with a higher score than I expected.

As far as resources go, I used my regular mix of [Microsoft Learn's free study material](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/certifications/microsoft-365-fundamentals/), and Whizlabs. The prep for this exam was a little more practical than some of my other exams lately, which is probably why I found it a bit more fun.
