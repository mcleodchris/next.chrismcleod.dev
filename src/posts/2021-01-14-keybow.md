This little [3-key KeyBow](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/keybow-mini-3-key-macro-pad-kit) is a fun little project, that really doesn’t take much time or skill to complete. The whole thing slots onto a Raspberry Pi Zero, turning it into a mini controller. I’m planning to use mine for controlling Microsoft Teams calls.
