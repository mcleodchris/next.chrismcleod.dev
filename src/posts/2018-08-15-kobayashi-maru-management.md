A great article by Rands on managing the communication of changes to groups of people - [Kobayashi Maru Management](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/kobayashi-maru-management/):

> A Kobayashi erupts immediately. The swift response starts with someone raising their hand virtually or otherwise and what they say or type immediately differentiates this situation from your unexpected daily developments. You think, but do not say, “Oh. Shit.”

I've quietly said "Oh. Shit." far too many times to count, and seen these situations erupt many, many, more times than that. I'm bookmarking this for future use.
