I caught [the first trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sYF1SXcWqQ) for the new _Marvel's Inhumans_ TV series. The whole thing looked so stiff, awkward, and sterile. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but based purely on the trailer I have zero desire to watch the show. Marvel's movies and Netflix series (mostly) manage to feel somewhat anchored to the "real world" despite how fantastical the plot or setup might beâ€¦ but _Inhumans_ had none of that quality on show.
