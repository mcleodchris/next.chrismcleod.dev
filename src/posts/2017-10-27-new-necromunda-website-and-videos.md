Games Workshop have released [a new website for the upcoming new version of Necromunda](https://necromunda.com/). Digging through the website gives plenty of new information about the game:

- The main boxset contains a game board with 3D barricades and accessories, for new players to play on
- Pre-order date is November 11th
- A supplemental book called "Gang War" will be released alongside the boxed game. This contains the "advanced rules" for playing Necromunda on a table filled with terrain, just like "old-school" Necromunda.

In addition, there are 5 new videos linked from the site which aren't yet publically available on the Warhammer TV YouTube channel. These videos give a quick overview of the game, plus a look at the new models included with the game:
