> [I Took A Freezing-Cold Shower Every Morning For A Month & This Is What Happened - Refinery29 UK](https://apple.news/A90rz9h9KSYCd330RYqpOsw)

Around 7-8 years ago I used to have a cold shower, nearly every morning for about 2 years, and I felt _great_ during that time - possibly the healthiest and most energetic I can remember being. I think it was something I picked up from a [Tim Ferris](http://www.timferriss.com/) book and decided to try. My shower method was slightly different than the one given in the article:

- start the shower as normal (hot), and step in
- while lathering up, stop the shower
- once lathered, switch the shower to cold, turn it back on, and rinse.

This method doesnâ€™t work in my current home as the shower works very differently and doesnâ€™t offer the same level of control. I guess I could suck it up and just start with cold?

In fact, thatâ€™s one to try tomorrow ðŸ¥¶
