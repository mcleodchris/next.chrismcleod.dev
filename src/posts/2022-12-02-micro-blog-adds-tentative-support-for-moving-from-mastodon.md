Mastodon doesn't lock you into one instance; you are able to "move" from an account on one instance, to an account on another, taking your followers with you. Behind the scenes, it largely based on ActivityPub. [Over on Micro.blog](https://www.manton.org/2022/12/02/moving-from-mastodon.html), Manton has used this feature to build a means of moving an account from Mastodon, to Micro.blog (which has some pretty good Fediverse support already), while explaining how it works at a technical level. According to the blog post, moving the other way - Micro.blog to Mastodon - is coming in a future update.

Personally I find this sort of data portability to be rather neat! I really wish more services built in this sort of interoperability.
