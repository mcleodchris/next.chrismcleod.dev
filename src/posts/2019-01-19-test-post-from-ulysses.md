I'm experimenting with different iOS editing apps again, and [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) is first on the block. So far I like that:

- it gets out of the way
- uses markdown
- exports to HTML
- and can export direct to WordPress

The obvious downsides are that there's no way for Ulysses to “hook in” to the Post Kinds data I use for anything beyond simple notes and articles. That, and the yearly subscription[^1], but I can't hold either of these against the developers.

[^1]: I have no issues paying for good quality software, or even subscribing if necessary. I just prefer to buy a license outright, rather than subscribe.
