I've been using the own-brand Element Games Kolinsky Sable brushes for a while now, and I have nothing but really good things to say about them. For the money they are **fantastic**. [Winsor and Newton Series 7's](http://www.winsornewton.com/uk/shop/brushes/water-colour/series-7-kolinsky-sable-brushes) are usually seen as the "gold standard" brushes for miniature painting (obviously it's one of those subjective things) -- I think the Element Games brushes are easily as good as the W&N's I've used over the years. At £19 for the set of 3, it's hard to argue against the value, either.

Don't just take my word for it: [multiple Slayer Sword winner David Soper likes them too](https://sproketsmallworld.blogspot.co.uk/2017/04/review-element-masterclass-brushes-from.html). Interestingly, he found them to be "stiff" compared to the Series 7's… I had the opposite experience in that mine were "softer" - particularly the "Regiment" brush - which has become my new go-to brush for most tasks.
