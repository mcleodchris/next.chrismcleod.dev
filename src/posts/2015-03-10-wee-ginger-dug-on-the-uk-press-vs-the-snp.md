[The Dug puts into words](https://weegingerdug.wordpress.com/2015/03/09/bell-end-of-the-union/) (far better than I could) some thoughts which came to me on the way home about the borderline racist fury coming from the UK press about the possibility of a large bloc of SNP MPs at the next Westminster election:

> The fury and bile originating from the UK media vastly outstrips in volume and quantity any anti-English sentiment found in Scotland. That’s not to say there is no such thing as anti-English sentiment in Scotland, it does exist. But it’s identified for what it is – an unacceptable prejudice. Anti-Scottish sentiment is dressed up as fair comment and is plastered all over mainstream UK newspapers.
