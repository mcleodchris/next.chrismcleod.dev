Ok, so it’s official, I’m switching to Mac. The iBook is all but fully ordered – I’m just waiting on my next pay cheque to come in. It’s sitting there smugly in my saved basket on the Apple Store UK. I can virtually hear it saying “I _knew_ you couldn’t resist!”

Barring any last-minute changes of heart on just how much I’m going to spend, here’s what I’ve gone for:

- ~~12-inch iBook G4 with 1.2GHz processor~~
- 14-inch iBook G4 with 1.33GHz processor
- 60GB HDD
- ~~Bluetooth module~~
- Additional 512MB RAM from Crucial

I’m lead to believe that installing the additional RAM will be a piece of cake. Far easier than spending the extra £140 for the same amount of RAM from Apple…

I’m counting the days already.

So… anybody want to buy a 18 month old Centrino laptop?

**Update 15/01/05** Ok, so I finally managed to find somewhere local that had iBooks in stock for me to give one a test drive. The 12” screen was a little too small for me, so I’ve upped my spec to the 14” model. To offset some of that extra cost, I’ve dropped the bluetooth module. So basically, I can just buy one off the shelf at the store and do the RAM upgrade later. As a bonus, the store guarantees everything for 2 years – so no paying for extended AppleCare!
