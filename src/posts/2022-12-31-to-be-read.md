For the first time in a long time, I have a physical shelf of books that form my "to be read" list. (aka TBR in bookish circles)

Over the last few years I've fallen out of the habit of reading regularly for fun. Which is odd, given I live with someone who has their own [book review blog](https://kapowskireads.com), [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@KapowskiReads), and read 210 books last year. This year I want to make a concerted effort to try and be more consistent, so I've put the books I want to read sometime soon front and centre in my office - they're on top of the sideboard that sits to my right when I'm at my computer desk, or left when I'm at my hobby desk, and within arms-reach of both.

The list itself is a mix of old favourites I haven't read in years, new fiction reads I'm sure I'll like, some new authors or genres I'm not familiar with, and a couple of non-fiction books to round things out. I still have 3 books I'm waiting on physical copies of to arrive. The full list, in no particular order, is:

1. Hallowed Ground - [Richard Strachan](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2823087.Richard_Strachan)
2. The Hollow King - [John French](https://www.john-french.com/)
3. Rogal Dorn: The Emperor's Crusader - [Gav Thorpe](https://gavthorpe.co.uk/)
4. The Hobbit - [J.R.R. Tolkien](https://www.tolkienestate.com/)
5. The Fellowship of the Ring - J.R.R. Tolkien
6. The Two Towers - J.R.R. Tolkien
7. The Return of the King - J.R.R. Tolkien
8. The Triumph of Saint Katherine - [Danie Ware](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5782588.Danie_Ware)
9. Helbrecht: Knight of the Throne - [Marc Collins](https://www.goodreads.com/malkydel)
10. Reaper Man - [Terry Pratchett](https://www.terrypratchettbooks.com/)
11. Mort - Terry Pratchett
12. Soul Music - Terry Pratchett
13. Dune - [Frank Herbert](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/58.Frank_Herbert)
14. Dead Lies Dreaming - [Charles Stross](https://www.antipope.org/charlie/)
15. Miss Marple: The Complete Short Stories - [Agatha Christie](https://www.agathachristie.com/)
16. Hercule Poirot: The Complete Short Stories - Agatha Christie
17. Briardark - [C. L. Werner](http://www.vermintime.com/)
18. Haven't You Heard? - [Marie Le Conte](https://marieleconte.tumblr.com/)
19. Escape - Marie Le Conte

Hopefully these won't be the only books I read through the year; I'm giving myself permission to pick up new books throughout the year as they pique my interest.

In terms of keeping track, I might use [Micro.Blog](https://micro.blog), as it's added several book-related features over the last couple of years, and has a nice and simple companion app for iOS, called Epilogue. Another option, that my partner recommended, is [The Storygraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/mrkapowski). Naturally, I'll be posting updates to this blog too!
