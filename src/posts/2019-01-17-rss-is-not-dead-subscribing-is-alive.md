In response to the Motherboard article "[The Rise and Demise of RSS](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3mm4z/the-rise-and-demise-of-rss)" I linked to a couple of days ago, [Colin makes some great points](https://cdevroe.com/2019/01/16/rss-subscribing).

RSS isn't dead, and might never beâ€¦ it's just been abstracted away for most people who don't need to care.
