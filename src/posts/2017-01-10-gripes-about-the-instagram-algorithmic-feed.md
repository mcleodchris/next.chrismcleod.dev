The algorithm-driven [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/misterkapowski/) feed was rolled out a while ago, but it's only recently I've noticed much of a difference. Unfortunately the difference, particularly in the last couple of weeks, has been increasingly negative. So much so I _really_ wish there was a way to opt-out!

Basically it comes down to I'm not seeing what I want to see at the time I want to see it, often leading me to just close the app after scrolling down a little bit. So as a way of "increasing engagement" it utterly fails.

A trivial example: I follow WWE on Instagram. Every Monday and Tuesday night, they post 6-12 photos from the goings on at Monday Night Raw, and Smackdown Live. Every Tuesday/Wednesday morning, I would like to open up Instagram and be able to scroll through to see what happened. ThisÂ *used* to work, but some time in the last few weeks it changed so these photos show up randomly in my feed over the next 2-4 days - after I've already got the information from other sources, and definitely past the point I _want_ the photos to show up at the top. The photos never show in chronological order, and never show as a batch of more than 1-2 at a time.

For the accounts I follow who aren't "brands" (i.e. friends, shared interest accounts, etc), often it's the people I like or comment on the least who appear near the top, and often the most trite, uninteresting photos they've posted. Why show me the video of a friend's baby's adorable first laugh, another friend's stunning macro photography, or a popular post from an interest account, when 4 out of 6 of the photos at the top of my feed are #MondayMotivation meme nonsense? With the other 2 being drinks/food from someone's night out 3 days ago?

Is it just me? I don't think so, but maybe it's just particularly bad on my feed? What're your experiences with Instagram lately?
