There is one thing on the internet that is – without a doubt – causing more buzz than anything else at the moment. No, not the new Harry Potter film (worth going to see, by the way). I’m talking about [Gmail](http://gmail.google.com/).

For weeks since it was announced, the blogosphere has been buzzing about it. Some have snorted in derision, some have placed it high upon a pedestal. Gmail isn’t even fully open to the public yet – it requires an “invite”.

These invites are highly desirable, so it would seem. All over the place, I’ve seen various contests to win an invite. Some [ask you to come up with something funny](http://web.archive.org/web/20060223182720/http://www.9rules.com/whitespace/our_thoughts/gmail_invite.php "Whitespace"). [Others just want a link](http://web.archive.org/web/20060223182720/http://www.flex-mx.com/archives/000886.html "FlexMX") (so can I have my invite now? ;)  ). The slightest mention of having a spare invite prompts a deluge of people you don’t even know asking for it. Googling for [“Gmail Invites”](http://web.archive.org/web/20060223182720/http://www.google.com/search?q=gmail+invites&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8 "Gmail Invites") returns page after page of people pimping this strang type of gold dust.

I guess it’s this process of invitation only accounts that are making everyone want Gmail so badly. To be in an “exclusive club” is quite a draw for some.

If it’s not that though, what is the draw? Is Gmail any good? I’ve put out the feelers (ooh-er) for an invite, so I’m hoping to be able to find out for myself, but maybe someone could enlighten me?

Isn’t just another web-based email service?
