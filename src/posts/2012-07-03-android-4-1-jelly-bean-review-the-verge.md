[Android 4.1 Jelly Bean review | The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/3/3134347/android-4-1-jelly-bean-review#notifications).

Is it just me, or does a lot of the Jelly Bean UI (particularly the Notifications Drawer) seem to take a few cues from Microsoft's [Metro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_%28design_language%29 "Metro (design language)")? It's mostly subtle, but - to me - it's definitely there.
