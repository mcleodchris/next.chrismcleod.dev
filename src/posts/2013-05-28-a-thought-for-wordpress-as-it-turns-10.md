You've come a long way, baby.

I remember when WordPress first appeared. I'd deployed the b2 blogging engine a couple of times before, and anything which made b2 easier to install/use/adapt was welcome. Amongst the (many) blog systems I'd tried up to then, b2 had the lowest technical barriers but was still an exercise in frustration to get installed and configured. In those early days of blog systems each product had its own quirks, and their own belief about what a blog was and how it should work. WordPress always tried to come across as "the Writer's" blogging system; once you had it setup to your preferences, it would stay out of the way. For the most part, anyway.

WordPress was never perfect, and it's still far from it, but you have to admire any system (particularly on the web) which is still going strong after 10 years, while remaining fairly close to it's original vision and principles. It made writing on the web more accessible to a generation of users, and for all its faults that should be celebrated.
