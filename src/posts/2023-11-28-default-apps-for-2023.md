I came across this collection of "what apps am I using?" posts via [Manton](https://www.manton.org/2023/11/28/default-apps-for.html), and thought it would be fun take part. If you want to see what others have posted, [Robb Knight is compiling a list](https://defaults.rknight.me/).

Overall I'm a fan of sticking fairly close to the defaults on the platforms I use (Windows + iOS) simply because it usually leads to having an easier time of things. There are a couple of items on this list that probably won't be on the list this time next year, but I'm still evaluating what their replacements might be.
