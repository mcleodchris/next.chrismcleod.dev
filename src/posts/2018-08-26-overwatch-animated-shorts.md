Speaking of Blizzard's animation department: I don't play Overwatch, but I've consistently _loved_ the [animated shorts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAYFVhxsaqDuOh4Ic5mRu5CiZVKCMVv66) they put out, highlighting a character. Their latest, ["Shooting Star," is for D.VA](https://youtu.be/q7j2d6YCQbg), but the [Reinhardt video "Honor and Glory"](https://youtu.be/sQfk5HykiEk) is by far my favourite. I've seen it said many times before, but I'll echo it: give us an animated Overwatch movie or episodic series, please, Blizzard!
