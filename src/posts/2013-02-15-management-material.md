I'm officially *management* now. Whether that's a good or bad thing only time will tell!

I've been given a secondary role at work of "People Manager." As you might have guessed, it's not a technical role; every staff member has a People Manager who is responsible for providing guidance, support, and a whole gaggle of approvals such as timesheets, procurement, holidays, and training.

One important part of the role is annual appraisals and performance ratings. This is something I'm quite interested in. My personal feeling is the appraisal system in most companies is broken - particularly once they grow past a certain size. While I'm under no illusions I'll be able to change the system here (and, to be fair, my experience last year was it was one of the better systems), it will be good to observe it from the inside, and pick up on the key pain points from both sides of the table.

Of course, I've been appointed to the role *just* in time for this year's annual appraisals, so nothing like being dropped in at the deep end!
