It looks like the first of my objectives to be completed will be my promotion. That's not to assume _successful_ completion, mind you. Our promotion process ends with a presentation to a three-person panel, and 8th February is the date scheduled for my panel presentation.

The format is fairly rigid, which isn't ideal for how I normally approach presentations, but it's out of my hands so I'll need to make the best of it. The biggest complication will be the strict 15 minute maximum time limit. If/when I get nervous, I can talk _at length_. The pendulum swung too far from my childhood deer-in-headlights freezing and stuttering. I have a lot to cover, so sticking to that time limit could be a big challenge. I have access to workshops and colleagues willing to help me practice, so I'm confident I can get it nailed down.
