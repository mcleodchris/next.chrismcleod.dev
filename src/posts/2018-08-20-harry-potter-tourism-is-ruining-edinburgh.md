[Harry Potter Tourism Is Ruining Edinburgh](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/zmqkp3/harry-potter-tourism-is-ruining-edinburgh). I'm not sure how much of this is greedy businesses, and how much is overeager tourists indulging their worst instincts, both unaware of the damage they're doing. The subheading on the Vice article says it all: "the city is full of crap gimmicks about a celebrity wizard."
