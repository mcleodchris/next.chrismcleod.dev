Just for the sake of it, I've started work on a semantically correct, CSS/XHTML strict compliant forum script.

At the moment, it's going to be as simple as possible, so I can get the basics done properly.

The main idea is to structure it using unordered lists. In my head, this is the correct way that a discussion _list_ should be structured... Not the nested tables that are normally used. Initially, it'll be a threaded discussion style forum, but it shouldn't be too hard to code it so it can be that or the other way of laying it out (I forget what that method is called).

It'll probably end up using PHP/MySQL as the backend, mainly because I know enough of these two to code it quickly. Maybe one day, I'll progress it to PHP/XML.

Should hopefully have a few test pages up in the next few days...
