An important milestone has been reached in my Armies on Parade entry - the majority of board construction is finished, and painting has begun! It's still only a few layers of paint, but every bit counts when there's only 39 days to go!

I primed the main building separate from the rest of the board, so I could reach tricky areas easier. I then [glued it to the board](/blog/goodnight-sweet-prince/).

As the Sector Imperialis boards have a tonne of moulded detail, I had to find a way of hiding gaps between the walls and the ground. This was done using a combination of Polyfilla, textured paste, and various grits of sand and gravel. I managed to enlist a couple of small helpers with this, asking them to take some of the grit and (literally) throw it around the building -- something which they quite enjoyed!

Once this initial layer was dry, I added some larger dollops of filler, and pressed a variety of objects into them: leftover floor sections, pieces clipped from spare wall sections, plastic H-beams, and a number of skulls. These then received the same shower of grits. These represent piles of larger rubble which have been pushed out of the way to make the building somewhat usable as shelter or storage.

The next morning, once the filler had dried overnight, all of the grit was covered in Terrain Fixer and left to dry for a couple of hours. Then, it was on to priming! The pictures below show the board from all sides, so you can see the details.

Yes, I intend to fix that gap...

Priming the rest of the board finished off the can of Chaos Black I'd started with the main building. With the undercoat dry, I started the first layer, based on [Peachy's Kill Team board recipe](https://www.warhammer-community.com/2018/08/24/24th-aug-building-a-kill-team-boardgw-homepage-post-4/), by spraying everything Mechanicus Standard Grey. Oddly, this only took about a third of a can.

With the main board making progress, it was time to move on to the other elements. the barrels, crates, and barricades all received a coat of Mechanicus Standard Grey, apart from two of the barrels which were sprayed Corax White.

But an Armies on Parade board needs an army, doesn't it? I finished assembling the first Inceptor squad, before priming them along with the [Lieutenant](/blog/warhammer-40000-primaris-space-marine-lieutenant-conversion/) and [Ancient](/blog/warhammer-40000-primaris-space-marine-ancient-conversion/) I'd previously made. The shoulder pads and helmets are separate for now, as they'll be primed a lighter colour.
