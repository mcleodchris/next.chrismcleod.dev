My work sent all UK staff this thoughtful Spring gift of wildflower seedballs, to easily add some wildflowers to our homes and gardens. Even the little note that came with the packs contains seeds and is plant-able - just bury it and give it some water. I'm just waiting on some new planters to arrive, then I'll get these added to the garden ðŸŒ¼
