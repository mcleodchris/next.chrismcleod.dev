I'm so disappointed I only recently found out about [Community](http://www.tv.com/shows/community/). It's one of the funniest shows I've watched in ages! Caley (who's already watched some of it) and I have been binge watching it on Netflix when we get a chance; we're part way through season 2 right now.

[Season 6](http://www.tv.com/shows/community/community/post/community-season-6-premiere-date--142116844617/) comes out in mid-March[^1], so I'm hoping to catch up to the end of season 5 by then!
