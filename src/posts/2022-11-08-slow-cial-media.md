I jokingly called Mastodon “slow-cial media” yesterday, because everything is happening on a time delay at the moment while the network adjusts to the extra traffic – me posting vs followers seeing the toot, interactions with the toot vs me getting the notification, me seeing new toots, etc; everything feels 1-3 hours behind when it happened – and I meant it as a good thing because it’s unintentionally made my experience a little bit nicer and more relaxing. There’s no pressure due to everything being fast-paced and “now, now, now!”

I can post something, then come back in a few hours to read any responses at my own leisure, and maybe read through any new toots that have managed to come through to my timeline in the meantime. It's all very asynchronous and lovely right now.
