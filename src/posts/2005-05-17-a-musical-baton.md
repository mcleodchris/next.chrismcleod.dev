We interrupt our scheduled Star Wars programming to bring you the latest _meme_ spreading through the blogosphere. [Pete](http://pixelicious.co.uk/) passed the baton to me, and before I pass it on, here’s the skinny on my music collection:

## Total volume of files on my computer is…

8.19GB, although some of it belongs to the Missus.

## The last CD I bought was…

_Promises/Warnings_ – Idlewild.

## Song playing right now is….

There isn’t one, as I’m at the office. Last one played on my iPod before getting to work was _Creeping Death (live)_ by Metallica.

## Five songs I listen to a lot or mean a lot to me are…

Like others, this is just what’s been played a fair bit recently.

1. _Why Do You Love Me?_ – Garbage
2. _Galvanise_ – Chemical Brothers
3. [_S.O.S._](https://web.archive.org/web/20060422031025/http://www.fivemileshigh.co.uk/media/b-movie-heroes_sos.mp3) – [B\*Movie Heroes](https://web.archive.org/web/20060422031025/http://www.bmovieheroes.co.uk/)
4. _Duel of the Fates_ – John Williams
5. _Bleed American_ – Jimmy Eat World

Five people to whom I’ll be passing the baton are…
