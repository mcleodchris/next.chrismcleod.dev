[Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) by Marco Arment has launched today. (_finally_, some of you might be saying)

I downloaded it on my way home, and haven't had a chance to try out any of the more interesting features, such as "Smart Speed" yet. However, with just a quick tap-through I've seen a few touches which suggest it's a very well-crafted app. I'm not convinced about the use of a non-"standard" font for the UI though, but that's just my preference.

Despite being around on the web when podcasting first came about (waaay before Odeo, for example) I never really got into podcasts in the same way a lot of other people did. I've started listening to a couple recently - and I'm always on the look out for more - and as I knew Overcast was "Coming Soonâ„¢" I stuck with Apple's really very mediocre Podcast app. I'll be interested to see if a better "podcatcher" helps me get into more podcasts over time.

You can read Marco's write up of the release [over on his blog](http://www.marco.org/2014/07/16/overcast).
