[Mike Monteiro](https://medium.com/@monteiro/) has written some of my favourite articles on about Twitter, most written from a place of frustration, sadness, and anger at the avoidable decline and lack of leadership. I wanted to bookmark them here so I had one simple place to refer back to them from, and to share them with any readers who hadn't yet come across them.
