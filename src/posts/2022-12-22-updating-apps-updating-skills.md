The festive break seems to be one of the times I manage to sit down and try something new. This year I'm taking the time to learn a little of the [PHP framework Laravel](https://laravel.com/), by way of re-writing [an app I made last year](https://ipaintedthis.app) with React and Firebase. That app always felt a little fragile to me, even though it succeeded at its basic functions - probably why I haven't gone back to update it at any point in the last year. In my defence, that app was a learning exercise too, as I wanted to brush up on React for my day job before starting on a project at the start of 2022.

But safe to say, I'm much more comfortable with "the old ways" of PHP. I've been writing PHP in one form or another for close to 25 years, and even though I wouldn't ever call myself an expert due to my on-off usage of it over the last decade, I do still have the basics of the language in my head. I can follow along and debug most code I've encountered just fine. PHP 8.x is different enough that I definitely need to follow some tutorials to write it, but there's still a lot I recognise. Laravel itself has a lot of similar concepts to frameworks I've used in the past, it just does them with modern practices and architecture. Again, lots I'm unfamiliar with, but plenty that I recognise.

Apart from making _I Painted This!_ more robust and supportable (in my view), one of the primary drivers for this exercise - other than as a convenient excuse for learning - is that the app primarily uses Twitter for authentication. That's not something I'm comfortable with any more, so it's got to go - and if I needed to do that change, I'd be as well giving it a complete overhaul!
