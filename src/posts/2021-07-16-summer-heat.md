Sortly after this screenshot was taken, my office hit 31.5Â°C, which is about the time I decided it was time to stop for the day.

If this is going to be the norm for the next few weeks, I'm going to have to find some way of cooling down the room that's better than my current option of "open the window". Scots aren't built for this sort of heat!
