There's a nice article over on [Warhammer Community, showing off Chris Peach's custom Kill Team game board](https://www.warhammer-community.com/2018/08/24/24th-aug-building-a-kill-team-boardgw-homepage-post-4/). I'm definitely going to be using this as some inspiration, as it's come at just the right time for me. Peachy's board is similar[^1] to what [I am planning to build for Armies on Parade](/blog/armies-on-parade-starting-the-display-board/), just scaled up to a larger canvas. I was struggling to decide how I should paint my Armies on Parade board, but the colours he's used would be perfect - muted, but enough of a contrast versus the armour of [the Space Marines](/blog/warhammer-40000-primaris-space-marine-ancient-conversion/) that they will stand out, which is the important thing.

[^1]: It's worryingly similar, in fact. Some elements are practically identical.
