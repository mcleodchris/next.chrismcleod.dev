A few days ago, version 0.2 of Mozilla Thunderbird (http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/) was released to the public.

It's miles faster, takes up less space (physical + RAM) and has a few new features and visual tweaks.

I use it and I highly recommend it! The junk mail filters alone make it miles beyond any other mail software I've used!
