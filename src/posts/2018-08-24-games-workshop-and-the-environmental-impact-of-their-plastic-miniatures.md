Shower thought: has Games Workshop been doing any research into using more sustainable sources for their plastic miniatures, [like LEGO have been doing](https://boingboing.net/2018/08/07/lego-to-launch-botanical-set-m.html)? They use a lot of the stuff, so I would have thought/hoped it's something that's creeping further up their internal agenda as time goes on. Come to think of it, have they ever stated what their sustainability and environmental impact policies are? Have they considered a sprue recycling scheme? They've already been (hilariously) [dinged by PETA](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/02/warhammer-fur-pelts-peta-live-flaying-throne-skulls) once, I can easily see Greenpeace putting the company in their cross-hairs at some point.
