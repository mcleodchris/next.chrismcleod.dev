MG Siegler has - much like myself - [converted to using the iPad full time as his mobile workstation](http://massivegreatness.com/sent-from-my-ipad):

> A couple weeks ago, [I wrote a quick note](http://parislemon.com/post/28709263355/sent-from-my-ipad) signaling my intent to predominantly use my iPad as my main computer when I travel going forward. What started as a successful two-day experiment led to a long weekend away last week. That went well enough that Iâ€™m confident in my choice. The iPad is my new road machine.

MG went for the [Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/tablet-accessories/ipad/ultrathin-keyboard-cover), which was my second-choice after the Apple Wireless Keyboard. He believes Apple will eventually release their own "keyboard in a cover" accessory, citing the [Microsoft Surface](http://www.microsoft.com/surface/) as a potential reason/influence. I don't think Apple will release their own accessory - for one, it'd be a bit "me too", with several options available on the market for quite some time (not to mention following in the wake of the Surface announcement); secondly, as one of the most-touted features of the Surface, I'm pretty sure Microsoft would see their ["Smart" keyboard cover](http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/18/3095396/microsoft-surface-cover-multitouch-keyboard) falling under [the "don't copy" patent licensing agreement](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/apple-licensed-design-patents-to-microsoft-in-anti-cloning-agreement/) held between the two companies.
