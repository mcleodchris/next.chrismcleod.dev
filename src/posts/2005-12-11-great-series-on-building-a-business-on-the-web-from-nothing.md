[Jennifer Laycock](https://web.archive.org/web/20060422031136/http://www.thelactivist.com/) at [Search Engine Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20060422031136/http://www.searchengineguide.com/), is writing a great little series on building a web startup from nothing: [“Zero Dollars, a Little Talent and 30 Days”](https://web.archive.org/web/20060422031136/http://www.searchengineguide.com/laycock/). In this (unsurprisingly) 30-part series she details her efforts to build a small t-shirt business while starting from a balance of $0. It’s a great experiment on the combined power of marketing, targeted sales, niche products and blogging. It’s only on day 18 and Jennifer is making a healthy profit – not huge profit, but it’s a profit none-the-less!
