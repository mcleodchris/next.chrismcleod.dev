I just added a new [page collecting the links](/links) of connections I'd made on Twitter. Yup, it's an old-school "Links Page." It's still a work in progress, having only the wargaming and miniature painting blogs listed for now. My intention is to eventually add links from other sources, like my feed subscriptions.
