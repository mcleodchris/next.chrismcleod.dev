With the recent change in ownership, I’ve been wondering if Flickr could become a viable alternative to Instagram for photo sharing (again)? I have a nostalgic view of Flickr, even though I haven’t used it in years. I closed my account, but I’d like to see them do well, and could be convinced to sign up.

As much as I’d love for people to be using their own site/domain, many (most?) don’t want that hassle - so a good service app will be their go-to.

As an aside, I need to get back in the habit of posting photos on this site. I haven’t really been taking pictures with the intent to share over the last couple of months, but one or two have ended up on social media regardless.
