Ads and websites which automatically redirect your iPhone to the App Store[^1] need to stop being a thing.

I'm seeing more and more instances of this user-hostile behaviour happening when I'm following a link on my phone. Usually it's caused by an ad unit on the page, but now and again, it's a site publisher who really, _really,_ wants you to install their app.

Here's the thing: if I wanted your app, I'd likely already have it installed. If I open a link to your website, I expect to (and am happy to) access your content there. Redirecting me to the App Store is a massive inconvenience and interruption; it takes me out of the app I was already using - often after I've already started reading your content - and puts me somewhere I wasn't expecting to be. It breaks my concentration as my brain switches from reading your content to looking at the app download page. *Assuming* I still want to read your content after being treated like this, I now have to close the App Store, reopen the app I was just in, and hope I can pick up where I left off. The publishers who treat their users in this way seem to think I'll:

- Download the app, and wait for it to install
- Create the usually mandatory account
- Validate said account by switching to my email
- Reopen the app, and try to find the content I'd clicked through to read in the first place
- Read it (at last!)

Err, how about "no"? I was already reading your content. If you want to pimp your app to me, put a button or mention of it at the end of the article.

When this kidnapping of my attention is caused by an ad, I'll *sometimes* go back to the site to finish reading, or I'll go back to where I found the link, and send it to Pocket to read later instead (and without the ads to interrupt me). When it's the publisher itself, chances are I'll be annoyed enough I won't return. You had your chance, and you chose to send me elsewhere instead. Either way, I sure as heck won't install any app advertised using this method.

So can we please put a stop to this? It's even worse than interrupting me [to beg for an app review](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/12/05/eff-your-review).

[^1]: This probably applies to Android and the Play Store as well, but I'm on an iPhone and so that's where I have experience of this problem happening.
