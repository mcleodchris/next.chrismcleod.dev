I’m a software developer with over 20 years of work experience, but I’ve been experimenting with technology and programming since I received my very first Commodore 64 in 1989. I’ve done everything from front-line IT support in small companies, through to leading development teams on key projects for industry and government.

Outside of work I’m a keen learner, having studied for – and earned – several certifications. I enjoy spending the rest of my free time immersed in one of my hobbies – more often than not miniature painting and tabletop wargaming.

## What I can do

- **Frontend Web development**, including React, Bootstrap, Angular, Tailwind, Eleventy.
- **Microsoft Azure certified**, DevOps experience.
- **Databases** – RDBMS and NoSQL, Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence.
- **Backend systems**, including .NET, Node, REST and GraphQL.
- **Experienced team lead**, mentor, and people manager.
