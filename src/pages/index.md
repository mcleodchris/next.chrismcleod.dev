<p class="p-note">I’m a software developer with over 20 years of work experience, but I’ve been experimenting with technology and programming since I received my very first Commodore 64 in 1989. I’ve done everything from front-line IT support in small companies, through to leading development teams on key projects for industry and government.</p>
