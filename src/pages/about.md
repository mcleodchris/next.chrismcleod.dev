## Just what the Dickens is this all about?

<p class="p-note">I’m a software developer with over 20 years of work experience, but I’ve been experimenting with technology and programming since I received my very first Commodore 64 in 1989. I’ve done everything from front-line IT support in small companies, through to leading development teams on key projects for industry and government.</p>

Outside of work I’m a keen learner, having studied for – and earned – several certifications. I enjoy spending the rest of my free time immersed in one of my hobbies – more often than not [miniature painting](/paintslam/2024/) and tabletop wargaming.

I've been thoughts, projects, and experiments across various iterations of a personal website, [for over 20 years](/archive/). This site is just the latest version.

## What I can do (in a "professional" sense)

- **Frontend Web development**, including React, Bootstrap, Angular, Tailwind, Eleventy.
- **Microsoft Azure certified**, DevOps experience, Containerisation, virtualisation, and system administration.
- **Databases** – RDBMS and NoSQL, Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence.
- **Backend systems**, including .NET, Node.JS, PHP, REST and GraphQL.
- **Experienced team lead**, mentor, and people manager.
