I loved Textpattern. There's an alternative universe where I'm still using it, having not been seduced by the idea of needing more features. Once upon a time I wrote what I believed to be the first XML-RPC interface for Textpattern, before it became a core feature. To this day, I use some Textile syntax when writing Markdown because I still have the muscle memory.

"Bon Anniversaire", Textpattern! ðŸ’›
