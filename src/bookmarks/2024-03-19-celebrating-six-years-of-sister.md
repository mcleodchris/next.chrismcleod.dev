Danie Ware's Sister Superior Augusta stories are some of my favourites in all Warhammer fiction. Despite having (I think) all of the printed stories, I'd actually missed Mercy - an oversight I've just corrected and downloaded to my Kindle!

I keep meaning to do a small project based on Augusta and her squad; maybe this year is when I finally get around to it?
