It's a bit like StumbleUpon, for a curated list of blogs and other "small web" sites, and powered by RSS feeds. I've spent a chunk of my morning reading posts I'd probably never have found otherwise and then hitting "next post" to get another.

It's [open-source](https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb) too!
